# Seams — Where New Work Can Attach (Ade)

> **Status:** Living architectural document. Regenerated; not hand-edited.
> Per-project instance of `~/.claude/methodology/templates/seams.md`.

> 11 crates, **456 canonical types**, **119 CI checks** at HEAD (`6f848825`, PHASE4-N-F-G-E cluster close).
> Reads CODEMAP (`docs/ade-CODEMAP.md`, regenerated at the same HEAD) for the module
> list + TCB colors, and the invariant registry (`docs/ade-invariant-registry.toml` —
> **314 entries** at HEAD) for the rule IDs that gate each closed surface.
>
> **This regeneration is a scoped INCREMENTAL catch-up through ONE cluster.** The prior file was generated
> at the PHASE4-N-F-G-C close (header `351d46bc` / 118 CI checks / 313 rules — the live WirePump feed + BA-02
> evidence wiring on the `--mode node` spine). It is brought current through **PHASE4-N-F-G-E** (closing now at
> `6f848825` — **live-feed bounded memory before authoritative decode/apply on the `--mode node` spine**). The
> G-E delta bounds two pre-existing UNBOUNDED peer-driven memory surfaces that the G-C live-feed wiring EXPOSED
> on the binary path (the G-C per-cluster security-review MEDIUM + the prior SEAMS §7 candidate #6): a GREEN
> per-mini-protocol reassembly-tail cap and a RED WirePump lookahead-depth cap, each fail-closed BEFORE the BLUE
> `ade_codec` decode path. The seam-relevant additions are **all CLOSED / fenced surface REDUCTIONS, NOT new
> extension points**: a NEW closed const `MAX_REASSEMBLY_TAIL_BYTES = 16 MiB` (GREEN `ade_network::session::core`)
> fail-closed via the NEW **additive CLOSED-enum variant** `SessionError::ReassemblyBufferOverflow` (no wildcard;
> the sole exhaustive consumer `ade_runtime::network::mux_pump::session_err_to_halt` handles it → drop the peer),
> and a NEW closed const `MAX_WIRE_PUMP_LOOKAHEAD = 256` (RED `ade_node::node_sync::pump_lookahead`,
> back-pressuring the existing bounded `mpsc`). **Both bounds are CLOSED LITERAL constants with NO runtime / CLI
> / env / config override** (the no-escape-hatch surface reduction). **No new module, no new `NodeBlockSource` /
> `CoordinatorEvent` variant.** **No BLUE crate was modified** — the 456 canonical-type total is unchanged
> (`session/` is GREEN-by-content, NOT a BLUE `ade_network` submodule path, so the new `SessionError` variant is
> NOT canonical-counted); the four changed files (`session::{core.rs, event.rs}` GREEN-by-content,
> `node_sync.rs` + `mux_pump.rs` RED) touch no BLUE crate. **Registry → 314 rules** (NEW `DC-LIVEMEM-01`,
> `tier = derived`, operational-hardening, `enforced`); **118 → 119 CI** (NEW `ci_check_live_feed_memory_bounds.sh`).
>
> **Boundary language (load-bearing — do NOT soften / do NOT broaden).** G-E bounds **peer-driven memory on the
> live `--mode node` feed BEFORE authoritative decode/apply** — and nothing more. Two closed caps, each
> fail-closed in front of the BLUE `ade_codec` decode path: the GREEN per-mini-protocol reassembly-tail cap
> (`MAX_REASSEMBLY_TAIL_BYTES = 16 MiB`, `SessionError::ReassemblyBufferOverflow`, drop the peer) and the RED
> WirePump lookahead-depth cap (`MAX_WIRE_PUMP_LOOKAHEAD = 256`, back-pressuring the existing bounded `mpsc`). The
> claim is **NARROW**: it is **NOT** full network DoS resistance, **NOT** peer resource fairness, **NOT** BA-02 /
> live-evidence readiness. G-E closed **ONE specific live-feed memory surface** — other DoS surfaces remain future
> hardening slices (e.g. a per-connection aggregate ceiling across the ~10 independent per-protocol reassembly
> buffers, and per-connection-COUNT / peer-fairness limits, are out of scope). **Precision (close-review — record,
> do not overclaim):** the reassembly cap is checked *post-extend*, so a single buffer's transient peak is `cap +
> one <=64 KiB mux frame` (~16.06 MiB), not an absolute 16 MiB; `ProtoBuffers` holds up to ~10 INDEPENDENT
> per-protocol buffers, each capped separately, so the per-connection aggregate ceiling is ~10× the single-buffer
> cap — still O(constant) per connection. The bounds are **CLOSED LITERAL constants — defensive implementation
> bounds, NOT Cardano semantic parameters**; a future hardening slice may *tighten* them, but **no runtime option
> (CLI / env / config) may disable them or set them unbounded** (`ci_check_live_feed_memory_bounds.sh` guard 3).
> There is **NO BLUE change**, **NO new `NodeBlockSource` / `CoordinatorEvent` variant**, **NO serve / forge /
> containment change** (the relay-loop containment gate `ci_check_node_run_loop_containment.sh` and the
> served-chain handoff fence `ci_check_served_chain_handoff_fence.sh` are byte-unchanged), and **NO live-evidence /
> BA-02 / RO-LIVE flip or claim**.

> ### PHASE4-N-F-G-E (closing, `6f848825`) — live-feed bounded memory before authoritative decode/apply on the `--mode node` spine
>
> N-F-G-E introduced / extended (all NEW surfaces are CLOSED / fenced — classified under §3 Closed / §4 Frozen;
> NOT new extension points). This is a surface REDUCTION (two fail-closed memory bounds in front of the BLUE
> decode path), NOT a new attach point:
>
> - **NEW CLOSED const + additive CLOSED-enum variant (GREEN, `ade_network::session::{core, event}`):**
>   `MAX_REASSEMBLY_TAIL_BYTES = 16 * 1024 * 1024` (`session/core.rs:49`). After `drain_protocol_items` drains
>   every COMPLETE item, an incomplete per-mini-protocol reassembly tail whose `buf.len() > MAX_REASSEMBLY_TAIL_BYTES`
>   (`core.rs:249`) returns the NEW `SessionError::ReassemblyBufferOverflow { protocol, len, cap }`
>   (`event.rs:195`) — **fail closed, drop the peer; no silent truncation, no partial decode**. The cap fires
>   **BEFORE** the BLUE `ade_codec` decode path. `SessionError` gains the variant **additively** — there is **NO
>   wildcard**; the SOLE exhaustive consumer `ade_runtime::network::mux_pump::session_err_to_halt` (`mux_pump.rs:278`)
>   maps it → `PeerHaltReason::ChainSyncDecodeError` (`mux_pump.rs:302-303`). Deterministic (pure `buf.len()`
>   check; the GREEN no-clock/rand/float/HashMap contract is preserved). `session/` is GREEN-by-content (NOT a
>   BLUE `ade_network` submodule `core_path`), so the new variant is **NOT canonical-counted**. **A closed memory
>   bound + a closed additive enum variant (a surface REDUCTION), NOT a new extension point.** Backs
>   `DC-LIVEMEM-01`. Gate: `ci_check_live_feed_memory_bounds.sh`.
> - **NEW CLOSED const (RED, `ade_node::node_sync`):** `MAX_WIRE_PUMP_LOOKAHEAD = 256` (`node_sync.rs:58`).
>   `pump_lookahead` stops the opportunistic `try_recv` drain at the cap (`node_sync.rs:126`,
>   `lookahead.len() >= MAX_WIRE_PUMP_LOOKAHEAD`), so the existing bounded `mpsc` (`LIVE_WIRE_PUMP_CHANNEL_CAP = 64`)
>   **back-pressures** the pump. Content-blind; the verdict-decoupled `NodeBlockSource` contract (closed 2-variant
>   `{WirePump, InMemory}`) + arrival order are **unchanged** — this is a depth cap on the existing opaque
>   `VecDeque<Vec<u8>>` lookahead, **not a new variant / source / verdict**. **A closed lookahead-depth bound (a
>   surface REDUCTION), NOT a new extension point.** Backs `DC-LIVEMEM-01`. Gate:
>   `ci_check_live_feed_memory_bounds.sh`.
> - **CHANGED (RED, `ade_runtime::network::mux_pump`):** `session_err_to_halt` maps the new
>   `SessionError::ReassemblyBufferOverflow { .. }` → `PeerHaltReason::ChainSyncDecodeError` (drop the peer). The
>   exhaustive `match` (no wildcard) is what makes the additive `SessionError` variant a closed extension.
> - **NEW CI gate** `ci_check_live_feed_memory_bounds.sh` (DC-LIVEMEM-01) — verifies BOTH bounds are CLOSED
>   LITERAL constants AND not wired to CLI / env / config (the no-escape-hatch guard 3; line comments are stripped
>   first so the doc-comments naming "CLI / env / config" do not self-trip). **Both caps are closed literals, NOT
>   tunables.**
>
> **Registry delta (N-F-G-E):** **314 rules** (313 → 314). **NEW `DC-LIVEMEM-01`** (`tier = derived`,
> operational-hardening — live-feed peer-driven memory bounded before authoritative decode/apply) at
> `status = enforced`. **No rule weakened.** **One new CI gate** (118 → 119): `ci_check_live_feed_memory_bounds.sh`.
>
> **Governance note (N-F-G-E).** G-E upholds the load-bearing structural lines. **Operational hardening, not an
> authority change:** `DC-LIVEMEM-01` is `tier = derived` — explicitly NOT BLUE consensus law (the rule text says
> so); it bounds shell/glue memory, never a chain fact. **The cap fires before the BLUE decode path** (`ade_codec`
> byte-unchanged) — no silent truncation, no partial decode, no unbounded fallback. **Closed source/enum surfaces
> stay closed:** the reassembly cap fails closed via an *additive* closed-enum variant
> (`SessionError::ReassemblyBufferOverflow`, no wildcard, one exhaustive consumer); `NodeBlockSource` stays the
> 2-variant `{WirePump, InMemory}`; both bounds are closed literal constants with no runtime escape hatch.
> **Containment is untouched:** the serve/forge/containment fences (`ci_check_node_run_loop_containment.sh` +
> `ci_check_served_chain_handoff_fence.sh`) are byte-unchanged. **No overclaim:** the claim is bounded memory
> before authoritative decode/apply — NOT network DoS resistance, NOT peer fairness, NOT BA-02 readiness; no
> `RO-LIVE` flip.
>
> ### PHASE4-N-F-G-C (closed, `351d46bc`) — live WirePump feed + BA-02 evidence wiring on the `--mode node` spine
>
> **Boundary language (carried — N-F-G-C — do not soften).** G-C closes the **MECHANICAL live-feed + evidence
> scaffolding ONLY**. The `--mode node` `On` arm is **live-feed-wireable**: when `--peer` is supplied,
> `spawn_live_wire_pump_source` builds a LIVE `NodeBlockSource::WirePump` by reusing the closed `dial_for_admission`
> + `run_admission_wire_pump` (the runtime `AdmissionPeerEvent` feeds the `WirePump` arm directly — no bridge, no
> reimplemented wire authority, no new variant). With a live feed the forge is observable when the feed is
> Continuing and a due leader slot is reached; **peer ACCEPT is NOT claimed here — it is operator-gated**
> (`RO-LIVE-01` partial / `blocked_until_operator_stake_available`), proven only by an operator-captured peer log
> through `ba02_evidence::correlate`. The BA-02 evidence I/O (`ba02_pass`) reads a real operator-captured
> peer-log file and runs it through the SOLE `Ba02Manifest` constructor (`correlate`); `write_ba02_manifest`
> accepts ONLY a `Ba02Manifest`, so a written manifest is always correlate-produced; **no synthetic manifest is
> committed** (the gate is vacuous-until-committed and sha256-binds the fixture). Ade self-accept /
> `ForgeSucceeded` / served-block / wire success **≠ peer acceptance**. With NO `--peer` the empty source still
> halts before any `ForgeTick` (forge-CAPABLE, not observable). The durable tip still advances only via
> `run_node_sync → pump_block` (no second bootstrap, CN-NODE-01); `run_node_sync` is UNMODIFIED;
> `ci_check_node_run_loop_containment.sh` is **byte-unchanged**. There is **NO new BLUE authority / canonical
> type, no new `NodeBlockSource` variant, no new `CoordinatorEvent` variant**, and the bounty acceptance
> criterion (an operator-witnessed accepted block) is **NOT** satisfied by this cluster. _(N-F-G-E added two
> closed memory caps in front of this live feed; it changed neither the live-feed wiring, the serve mechanism, nor
> any BLUE authority.)_
>
> N-F-G-C introduced / extended (all NEW surfaces are CLOSED / fenced ATTACH POINTS — classified under §3 Closed
> / §4 Frozen; NOT new extension points; carried unchanged from the G-C close):
>
> - **NEW node-spine ATTACH POINT that REUSES existing closed wire infra (RED, `ade_node::node_lifecycle`):**
>   the live WirePump feed (S1) — `spawn_live_wire_pump_source(peer_addrs: &[String], network_magic: u32,
>   recovered_tip: Option<&ChainTip>) -> NodeBlockSource`. RED wiring ONLY: it reuses the closed
>   `ade_runtime::admission::{dial_for_admission, run_admission_wire_pump}` VERBATIM (no reimplementation, no new
>   wire authority) and feeds their `AdmissionPeerEvent` output DIRECTLY into the `WirePump` arm via
>   `NodeBlockSource::from_wire_pump(rx)` (the node spine consumes the runtime event type — no bridge). Each
>   `--peer` is dialed in a `tokio::spawn` whose `AdmissionPeerEvent` output is fed into a **bounded** `mpsc`
>   (`LIVE_WIRE_PUMP_CHANNEL_CAP = 64`); the `start_point` is the recovered tip (`Point::Block`) or
>   `Point::Origin`. The `On` arm wires it iff `--peer` is supplied (`let mut source = if live_feed_wired {
>   spawn_live_wire_pump_source(...) } else { NodeBlockSource::in_memory(Vec::new()) }`). **The live source is a
>   FILL of the closed 2-variant `NodeBlockSource` {WirePump, InMemory} (NOT a new variant), adds no second
>   tip-advance path, carries no verdict.** Honest-scope (C3, mirrors `admission::bootstrap::
>   spawn_wire_pumps_for_admission`): an unparseable addr or a `dial_for_admission` failure is logged-and-dropped
>   — never fatal, never a fabricated address, never a silent tip graft; if no peer yields a live pump the feed
>   ends and the loop halts clean (same outcome as the empty source). **This CLOSES the prior §7 candidate #0
>   "live network serve + operator-peer surface (G-C)" on the CONSUME/FEED side** — the live feed is now wired.
>   Gate: `ci_check_served_chain_handoff_fence.sh` BROADENED in place (S1); `ci_check_node_run_loop_containment.sh`
>   byte-unchanged.
> - **CHANGED (RED, fn-visibility promotion — reuse, no reimpl, `ade_node::admission::bootstrap`):**
>   `build_n2n_version_table` is promoted `fn` → `pub(crate) fn` (S1) so `node_lifecycle::spawn_live_wire_pump_source`
>   can REUSE the existing N2N version-table builder instead of reimplementing it. No behavior change.
> - **NEW RED BA-02 evidence-I/O module (RED, `ade_node::ba02_pass` — `//! RED`):** operator-pass BA-02 evidence
>   file I/O (S2). `correlate_peer_log_file(ade: &AdeForgeRecord, peer_log_path: &Path) -> io::Result<BA02Outcome>`
>   reads the operator-captured peer-accept JSONL file → GREEN `ba02_evidence::parse_peer_accept_events`
>   (allow-list) → `ba02_evidence::correlate` (the SOLE `Ba02Manifest` ctor); a missing/unreadable file fails
>   closed (`io::Error`), never a synthesized acceptance. `write_ba02_manifest(manifest: &Ba02Manifest, out_path:
>   &Path) -> io::Result<()>` accepts ONLY a `Ba02Manifest` (which only `correlate`'s exact-match arm
>   constructs), so a written manifest is ALWAYS correlate-produced. Registered `pub mod ba02_pass;` in `lib.rs`.
>   **NO new closed enum / registry** — two file-I/O fns over the pre-existing closed `Ba02Manifest` / `BA02Outcome`
>   / `PeerAcceptEvent` / `NoEvidenceReason` vocabulary; the GREEN `ba02_evidence` correlator is **UNCHANGED**.
>   Constructs no evidence, derives no acceptance, never coerces a non-acceptance line. Reached by no binary arm
>   at this HEAD (exercised by `crates/ade_node/tests/node_operator_pass_ba02.rs` — incl. the env-gated
>   `node_operator_pass_ba02_live`). Backs the BA-02 leg of `RO-LIVE-06` / `CN-OPERATOR-EVIDENCE-01`.
> - **GREEN (BA-02 evidence correlator — UNCHANGED, `ade_node::ba02_evidence`):** `correlate` stays the SOLE
>   `Ba02Manifest` constructor; the closed `BA02Outcome` / `PeerAcceptEvent` / `NoEvidenceReason` / versioned
>   `Ba02Manifest` surface is byte-unchanged. G-C only *consumes* it from the new RED `ba02_pass` I/O wrapper.
> - **NEW CI gate** `ci_check_ba02_evidence_manifest_schema.sh` (S2, RO-LIVE-06 BA-02 evidence; mirrors
>   `ci_check_operator_evidence_manifest_schema.sh`) — when a committed `docs/clusters/PHASE4-N-F-G-C/CE-G-C-LIVE_*.toml`
>   manifest is present, it verifies the closed **8-field** schema (`schema_version`, `block_hash`, `slot`,
>   `peer_log_file`, `peer_log_file_sha256`, `peer_log_capture_command`, `peer_log_filter`, `accept_event_kind`),
>   `schema_version == 1`, and that `peer_log_file_sha256` matches the actual SHA-256 of the committed peer-log
>   fixture it binds. When NO manifest is committed (the typical state — the live operator pass is
>   `blocked_until_operator_stake_available`), the gate is **vacuously satisfied** (no manifest, no claim). This is
>   **the no-synthetic-manifest enforcer**: a hand-authored manifest with no real fixture, or a tampered fixture,
>   FAILS.
> - **BROADENED CI gate (in place, NOT new)** `ci_check_served_chain_handoff_fence.sh` (S1, DC-NODE-06
>   serve-ingress clause) — the OWNERS set is broadened from `{node_lifecycle.rs}` to `{node_lifecycle.rs,
>   node_sync.rs}` so the fence still holds if the serve owner moves; guard (3) is flipped from a 3-name
>   **deny-list** to an **ALLOW-LIST** (every node-spine unbounded handoff channel MUST carry `SelfAcceptedHandoff`
>   — any other token is a violation — and at least one `UnboundedSender<SelfAcceptedHandoff>` must be present).
>   Guards (1) every `push_atomic(` fed by `into_accepted()` and (2) no direct `served_chain_admit(` on the node
>   spine are unchanged. A **net tightening**. The CI count does NOT change for this file (modified in place).
> - **NEW runbook** `docs/evidence/phase4-n-f-g-c-operator-pass-README.md` (S2) — the operator-pass execution
>   runbook for the live BA-02 leg (how to capture the peer-accept log, what `correlate` requires, and the
>   no-synthetic-manifest discipline). NEW test file `crates/ade_node/tests/node_operator_pass_ba02.rs`
>   (`correlate_wired_to_operator_peer_log`, `correlate_from_operator_log_file_is_deterministic`, env-gated
>   `node_operator_pass_ba02_live`); the live-feed reachability/serve legs are
>   `node_sync::tests::live_wire_pump_feed_reaches_forge_tick` +
>   `forge_succeeds::live_feed_forge_serve_loopback_returns_forged_block`.
>
> **Registry delta (N-F-G-C):** stays **313 rules** — **no new rule**. `RO-LIVE-01` (stays `partial` — its
> `open_obligation` now records that G-C wired the MECHANICAL half; the LIVE half stays
> `blocked_until_operator_stake_available`), `RO-LIVE-06` (stays `enforced` — schema + mechanics only; LIVE BA-02

> **Governance note (N-F-G-C).** G-C upholds the load-bearing structural lines. **Mechanical scaffolding, not an

>
> - **NEW CLOSED surface (GREEN, `ade_runtime::producer::self_accepted_handoff`):** `SelfAcceptedHandoff` (S1)

> - **NEW fenced seam (RED, `ade_node::node_lifecycle`):** the self-accept→serve handoff seam — `ForgeActivation`
>   gains a private `handoff_tx: Option<mpsc::UnboundedSender<SelfAcceptedHandoff>>` + a `with_handoff_sender(tx)
>   -> Self` builder (S2). The dispatcher `run_node_lifecycle_inner` (`On` arm) `tokio::spawn`s a **sibling**

> - **CHANGED (RED, `ade_node::node_sync::forge_one_from_recovered`):** now returns `(CoordinatorEvent,

## 1. Surface Reduction Rules

> External inputs reduce to canonical form before entering authoritative pipelines. Ade
> is a Cardano node, not a request/response service — its "external surfaces" are the
> N2N/N2C wire, operator-supplied key/genesis/opcert files, the cardano-cli UTxO seed
> dump, the cardano-cli `query protocol-parameters` JSON (N-F-G-A), the Mithril snapshot
> manifest (N-Y), the Mithril production-bootstrap composition (N-Z), the Conway genesis
> file (N-Y), the operator-captured peer-accept JSONL log (BA-02 evidence, N-F-C / wired
> N-F-G-C), and argv. Each reduces to a canonical BLUE type (or a closed evidence outcome)
> before any authoritative transition. There is **no HTTP/gRPC/message-bus ingress**
> (confirmed absent — not a gap).
>
> **N-F-G-C note (live feed + BA-02 evidence I/O):** the `--mode node` `On` arm is now
> **live-feed-wireable** from `--peer`. The same N2N inbound wire surface (below) is the live
> feed: `spawn_live_wire_pump_source` reuses the closed `ade_runtime::admission::{dial_for_admission,
> run_admission_wire_pump}` VERBATIM and feeds their `AdmissionPeerEvent` output into the closed
> `NodeBlockSource::WirePump` arm via `from_wire_pump` (a FILL of the existing arm — NOT a new
> ingress *protocol* surface, NOT a new variant, NOT a new wire authority). It introduces **no new

### Surface: N2N inbound wire (received blocks/headers/txs; the LIVE `--mode node` feed since N-F-G-C)

```
Surface: N2N mini-protocol traffic over TCP+mux (RED ade_runtime::network::{n2n_listener, mux_pump, n2n_dialer};
  the --mode node On-arm LIVE feed reuses ade_runtime::admission::{dial_for_admission, run_admission_wire_pump} via
  ade_node::node_lifecycle::spawn_live_wire_pump_source — N-F-G-C)
Reduces to: decoded mini-protocol messages → tag-24-stripped inner bytes → PreservedCbor<T> → DecodedBlock (BLUE ade_codec)
Pipeline (fixed; steps may not be reordered or shortcut):
  1. mux::frame::decode_frame                       (BLUE — single frame-decode authority)
  2. session::core::step                            (GREEN — partial-frame buffer + payload reassembly + closed AcceptedMiniProtocol registry)
  3. per-mini-protocol *_transition reducer         (BLUE — chain_sync / block_fetch / etc.)
  3a. tag-24 strip (N-X)                             (BLUE — decompose_blockfetch_block / decompose_rollforward_header delegate to ade_codec::unwrap_tag24; RED admission::runner / follow call ade_codec::unwrap_tag24 directly — no hand-rolled parse)
  3b. (N-F-G-E) memory bound BEFORE decode           (GREEN session::core: after drain_protocol_items drains every COMPLETE item, an incomplete per-mini-protocol reassembly tail over MAX_REASSEMBLY_TAIL_BYTES = 16 MiB ⇒ SessionError::ReassemblyBufferOverflow ⇒ mux_pump::session_err_to_halt drops the peer — fail-closed, no silent truncation, no partial decode; closed literal const, no CLI/env/config escape hatch. This is a fail-closed BOUND in front of step 4, NOT a new pipeline step. DC-LIVEMEM-01)
  4. ade_codec decode_block_envelope / decode_*     (BLUE — sole PreservedCbor construction site, over the verbatim tag-24-stripped inner bytes)
  5. ade_ledger::receive::reducer / mempool_ingress (BLUE — header→body bridge / wire-ingress chokepoint)
  6. forward_sync::reducer → forward_sync::pump (N-Y)  (GREEN admit-plan over the BLUE admit chokepoint → RED durability-ordered driver; AdvanceTip only after StoreBlockBytes + AppendWal ack)
  7. block_validity / tx_validity / admission        (BLUE verdict; GREEN admission compares already-authoritative outputs)
N-F-G-C LIVE-FEED PATH (the --mode node On arm; CONSUME side of the prior §7 candidate, now wired):
  L1. spawn_live_wire_pump_source(&cli.peer_addrs, network_magic, recovered_tip)  (RED — REUSES dial_for_admission + run_admission_wire_pump VERBATIM; build_n2n_version_table reused via pub(crate); start_point = recovered tip Point::Block or Point::Origin)
  L2. per --peer: tokio::spawn { dial_for_admission(addr) → run_admission_wire_pump(...) → bounded mpsc::channel(LIVE_WIRE_PUMP_CHANNEL_CAP = 64) }  (an unparseable addr / dial failure is logged-and-dropped — C3 honest-scope; non-fatal; no fabricated addr, no tip graft)
  L2a. (N-F-G-E) pump_lookahead depth cap            (RED node_sync: the opportunistic try_recv drain stops at MAX_WIRE_PUMP_LOOKAHEAD = 256, so the bounded mpsc (cap 64) back-pressures the pump; content-blind; the closed 2-variant NodeBlockSource + arrival order are unchanged; closed literal const, no CLI/env/config escape hatch — DC-LIVEMEM-01)
  L3. NodeBlockSource::from_wire_pump(rx)            (RED — a FILL of the closed WirePump arm; NOT a new variant; yields ordered Block bytes ONLY, skips TipUpdate, ends on Disconnected — DC-SYNC-01)
  L4. → run_node_sync → pump_block                  (the SAME single durable tip-advance — step 6 above; no second tip-advance, no verdict)
Cross-surface state sharing: the served ServedChainSnapshot (read by both serve and broadcast paths);
  the per-peer outbound map (PerPeerOutbound) is keyed by PeerId — no cross-peer byte leakage.
  The tag-24 unwrap step (N-X) is the SAME shared ade_codec authority used by the serve path's wrap step.
  The forward-sync persisted ChainDb + FileWalStore are the same stores the recovery path (recovery::restart)
  reconciles on warm-start (DC-WAL-*; WalTailFingerprintMismatch fail-fast). N-F-C: the SAME stores the
  --mode node lifecycle (node_lifecycle + node_sync) opens; pump_block gains its FIRST production caller
  in node_sync::run_node_sync. N-F-D: the relay loop (run_relay_loop) is the live-run owner that drives
  run_node_sync each iteration. N-F-G-C: the --mode node On arm now feeds run_node_sync from a LIVE
  NodeBlockSource::WirePump (reusing the admission dial + pump) when --peer is supplied — the live feed is
  the SAME N2N surface; with no --peer the empty source halts the loop before any SyncOnce/ForgeTick. The WAL
  is also where the N-F-A additive SeedEpochConsensusInputsImported (tag 3) provenance lives — disjoint from
  the AdmitBlock fp-chain.
Rule (N-F-G-C live feed; ci_check_served_chain_handoff_fence.sh BROADENED + ci_check_node_run_loop_containment.sh
  byte-unchanged): the live feed is a REUSE of the closed dial + pump (no new wire authority, no reimpl); the
  source stays the closed 2-variant NodeBlockSource (a from_wire_pump FILL, NOT a new variant); the tip advances
  ONLY via run_node_sync → pump_block (no second tip-advance); a dial/parse failure is logged-and-dropped, never
  fatal / fabricated / a tip graft.
HONEST SCOPE: G-C wires the MECHANICAL live feed ONLY. With a live feed the forge is observable when the feed is
  Continuing and a due leader slot is reached, but peer ACCEPT is NOT claimed here — it is operator-gated
  (RO-LIVE-01 partial / blocked_until_operator_stake_available), proven only by an operator-captured peer log
  through ba02_evidence::correlate. Ade self-accept / served-block / wire success != peer acceptance. BA-02 is
  satisfied nowhere.
N-F-G-E (bounded memory before decode/apply): the two caps above (reassembly tail + lookahead depth) bound
  peer-driven memory on this live feed BEFORE authoritative decode/apply — a NARROW claim. NOT full network DoS
  resistance, NOT peer fairness, NOT BA-02/live-evidence readiness. Precision: the reassembly check is post-extend
  (single-buffer transient peak cap + one <=64 KiB frame ~16.06 MiB); ProtoBuffers holds ~10 INDEPENDENT
  per-protocol buffers each capped (per-connection aggregate ~10x single-buffer, still O(constant)/connection).
  Per-connection-COUNT / peer-fairness limits are a SEPARATE out-of-scope surface.
```

### Surface: operator-captured peer-accept log → BA-02 evidence (RED file I/O wired N-F-G-C over the GREEN N-F-C correlator)

```
Surface: operator-captured peer-accept JSONL log file (RED ade_node::ba02_pass over GREEN ade_node::ba02_evidence)
Reduces to: closed PeerAcceptEvent set → BA02Outcome {Ba02Manifest | NoEvidence} via correlate (the SOLE Ba02Manifest ctor)
Pipeline (RED file read → allow-list parse → exact-match correlate; fail-closed on a missing/unreadable file):
  1. correlate_peer_log_file(ade, peer_log_path)        (RED ba02_pass — std::fs read; a missing/unreadable file ⇒ io::Error, NEVER a NoEvidence and NEVER a manifest)
  2. parse_peer_accept_events                            (GREEN ba02_evidence — ALLOW-LIST: only `peer_served_block` / `peer_chain_tip` discriminators → PeerAcceptEvent; every weaker/unknown/malformed line DROPPED, never coerced)
  3. AdeForgeRecord (forged hash + slot)                 (read VERBATIM from the BLUE-minted forge record — NEVER recomputed; no new BLUE authority)
  4. correlate(ade, peer_log)                            (GREEN — pure/total/deterministic, HASH-PRIMARY; emits BA02Outcome::Ba02Manifest ONLY on an exact forged-hash↔peer-accept match at the matching chain point, no conflicting signal; else NoEvidence{reason})
  5. write_ba02_manifest(&Ba02Manifest, out)             (RED ba02_pass — the ARGUMENT TYPE is the gate: it accepts ONLY a Ba02Manifest, which only correlate's exact-match arm constructs; there is NO path emitting a manifest from a NoEvidence outcome or from raw operator input, so a written manifest is ALWAYS correlate-produced)
Cross-surface state sharing: NONE. GREEN evidence comparing already-authoritative outputs; forges nothing,
  admits nothing, persists no node state. ba02_pass is RED file I/O ONLY — it constructs no evidence, derives no
  acceptance, never coerces a non-acceptance line. A Ba02Manifest is a CLAIM ABOUT authority, not authority.
Rule (RO-LIVE-06 / CN-OPERATOR-EVIDENCE-01, ci_check_ba02_evidence_closed.sh + ci_check_ba02_evidence_manifest_schema.sh):
  correlate is the ONLY Ba02Manifest constructor; write_ba02_manifest accepts ONLY a Ba02Manifest; NO self-evidence
  token (ForgeSucceeded / self_accept / block_received / served-block / wire-success / agreement_verdict / "agreed")
  may be an acceptance source; NO committed synthetic manifest. The new schema gate verifies the closed 8-field
  manifest + schema_version == 1 + peer_log_file_sha256 == sha256(committed fixture) WHEN a CE-G-C-LIVE_*.toml is
  committed, and is VACUOUSLY satisfied when none is (the typical state). The versioned Ba02Manifest
  (BA02_MANIFEST_SCHEMA_VERSION = 1) is a version-GATED contract (§4).
HONEST SCOPE (N-F-G-C): G-C wires the BA-02 evidence I/O (ba02_pass) but is reached by NO binary arm at this HEAD
  (tested only — incl. the env-gated node_operator_pass_ba02_live). A real BA-02 result needs a REAL
  operator-captured peer log naming the EXACT Ade-forged hash, through correlate, against a peer that can grant
  leadership (C1 private testnet or C2 preprod with provisioned stake). BA-02 is satisfied NOWHERE at this HEAD;
  RO-LIVE-01 stays partial / operator-gated.
```

### Surface: --mode node forge constants (current protocol-parameters source + checked clock + off-epoch guard, N-F-G-A)

```
Surface: --mode node forge-constant fidelity (GREEN ade_runtime::consensus_inputs::{protocol_params, canonical} + GREEN ade_runtime::clock::checked_millis_to_slot + GREEN-by-fn ade_node::node_sync::forge_epoch_admission)
Reduces to: oracle pparams JSON preimage → current ProtocolParameters (hash-bound) + a checked SlotNo (before-anchor fails closed) + a ForgeEpochAdmission verdict (off-epoch fails closed before leadership)
Pipeline (fixed; the forge constants are sourced REAL, hash-bound, and the two boundaries fail closed inside the existing forge fence):
  S2a-1. require_forge_current_pparams()             (GREEN — protocol_params_json carried OUTSIDE the frozen 15-field fingerprint; preimage absent ⇒ ForgeCurrentPParamsError::PreimageAbsent)
  S2a-2. blake2b_256 bind                            (GREEN — blake2b_256(protocol_params_json) != fingerprinted protocol_params_hash ⇒ BindMismatch)
  S2a-3. parse_protocol_parameters_json(json, magic) (GREEN — exact decimal/scientific → ade_ledger::rational::Rational by INTEGER arithmetic; no f64/serde-float; a non-exact literal ⇒ ProtocolParamsParseError::InexactRational; bad shape ⇒ JsonShape; wrapped as ForgeCurrentPParamsError::Parse)
  S2a-4. install at seed/import                      (RED admission::{seed_to_snapshot, bootstrap} — build_seed_ledger installs the CURRENT ProtocolParameters into the recovered ledger, never ProtocolParameters::default(); warm-start preserves it)
  S2-5.  operator config ingress                     (RED operator_forge — real parse_opcert_envelope + parse_shelley_genesis; parse_simple_* retired on the node path; genesis ⇒ clock/KES/network constants ONLY)
  S3-6.  checked_millis_to_slot(tick, start, slot0, len)  (GREEN — before-anchor tick (tick < start) ⇒ SlotAlignmentError::BeforeGenesisAnchor recorded in last_slot_alignment_fail; otherwise the EXACT millis_to_slot result; no float, no wall-clock; saturating millis_to_slot left intact for non-forge callers)
  S4-7.  forge_epoch_admission(slot, era_schedule, seed_epoch)  (GREEN-by-fn — via the BLUE EraSchedule::locate; within seed epoch ⇒ WithinSeedEpoch; any other / unlocatable ⇒ OffEpoch; called BEFORE query_leader_schedule, so an off-epoch forge fails closed before leadership / KES signing; drives NO NonceInput::EpochBoundary / CandidateFreeze nonce promotion)
  8.     (off-epoch outcome)                          (routes through the EXISTING closed 9-variant CoordinatorEvent::ForgeNotLeader — NO new variant added)
Cross-surface state sharing: the recovered current ProtocolParameters installed at seed/import is the SAME
  parameter record the warm-start recovery preserves and the On-arm ForgeActivation carries (protocol_version +
  pparams). The checked clock seam is the SAME RED clock seam the N-F-E/N-F-F forge tick uses (only a SlotNo
  crosses; SystemTime/Instant/float never cross into GREEN/BLUE). The off-epoch guard reuses the BLUE
  EraSchedule::locate the rest of the consensus core uses. NONE of these boundaries advance a tip, serve,
  admit, or gossip.
Rule (DC-EPOCH-03 / CE-G-A-1/2/2a/4; ci_check_recovered_ledger_pparams_sourced.sh + ci_check_node_forge_real_cli_ingress.sh + ci_check_node_forge_single_epoch_fail_closed.sh + ci_check_genesis_consistency_fixture_present.sh):
  the recovered ledger pparams are sourced from the oracle preimage (never defaulted/genesis-initial); the
  config ingress uses the REAL parsers (no parse_simple_* on the node path); the off-epoch guard runs BEFORE
  leadership via EraSchedule::locate (no fabricated epoch, no nonce promotion); protocol_params has NO float
  path (exact Rational or fail closed); checked_millis_to_slot MUST NOT saturate a before-anchor tick (fail
  closed); the protocol_params_json preimage stays OUTSIDE the 15-field canonical fingerprint. run_relay_loop's
  containment is SEMANTICALLY UNCHANGED — the new boundaries sit inside the existing forge fence.
HONEST SCOPE: this is forge-fidelity HARDENING — real config, current pparams, two fail-closed boundaries. It
  does NOT serve / admit / gossip / advance a durable tip; the forge stays subordinate + self-accept-only; on
  the empty binary source the loop halts before any ForgeTick (forge-CAPABLE, NOT observable — RO-LIVE-01).
  The S1 genesis-consistency fixture is evidence input, never runtime authority. BA-02 satisfied nowhere.
```

### Surface: --mode node operator-key ingress (the forge-intent classifier + operator-material site, N-F-F; real parsers N-F-G-A)

```
Surface: operator-key CLI flags for --mode node (GREEN ade_node::forge_intent + RED ade_node::operator_forge)
Reduces to: ForgeIntent {On(ForgePaths) | Off} (presence classification) → OperatorForgeMaterial (custody shell + GenesisAnchor + pool_id + clock anchors) → ForgeActivation
Pipeline (fixed; presence is classified PURELY first, then a single named RED ingress site, then activation assembly):
  1. GREEN classify_forge_intent(cold, kes, vrf, opcert, genesis: Option<&Path>)  (pure/total over all 2^5 flag-PRESENCE combinations; never observes file contents; all five present ⇒ On(ForgePaths); none ⇒ Off; any partial subset ⇒ Err(ForgeIntentError::PartialKeySet{present, missing}) — static flag-name strings only)
  2a. Off  → run_relay_loop(…, None)                 (the EXACT N-F-E relay, verbatim — keys absent ⇒ exact relay-only; the planner is fed NotDue and never returns ForgeTick)
  2b. PartialKeySet → NodeLifecycleError::ForgeKeyIngress → EXIT_NODE_FORGE_KEY_INGRESS_FAILED = 44  (partial ⇒ fail closed; never a silent relay fallback, never a missing/zero/fabricated key)
  2c. On(paths) → operator_forge::build_operator_forge_material(&paths)  (the single named RED operator-material ingress site)
       i.   load_operator_producer_shell(&paths)      (RED — reuses load_cold_signing_key_skey / load_vrf_signing_key_skey / load_kes_skey_any_format; no reimpl)
       ii.  BLUE structural validators                (KES via ade_crypto::kes_sum::Sum6Kes::raw_deserialize_signing_key_kes — byte layout IS the validator; ProducerShell::init enforces the opcert shape + KES-period-vs-opcert freshness bound, CN-PROD-02)
       iii. pool_id = Hash28(blake2b_224(cold_vk))     (the ONE named derivation — never fabricated)
       iv.  (N-F-G-A S2) REAL parse_opcert_envelope + parse_shelley_genesis  (the parse_simple_* stubs are RETIRED on the node path; genesis extracts clock/KES/network constants ONLY — NOT a bootstrap source, NOT a new semantic genesis authority)
       v.   (N-F-G-A S2) protocol_version + pparams from the recovered CURRENT ledger view  (current_forge_constants_from_recovered — NO LONGER produce-path ProtocolParameters::default() defaults)
  3. coordinator_init → ForgeActivation → run_relay_loop(…, Some(&mut activation))  (keys present ⇒ forge-capable, built on the single recovered BootstrapState; N-F-G-C: the relay loop's source is a LIVE NodeBlockSource::WirePump when --peer is supplied)
Cross-surface state sharing: the OperatorForgeMaterial.shell (ProducerShell) is RED-confined key custody —
  OperatorForgeMaterial is NOT Debug/Serialize; no byte accessor / serialization / logging; the private
  KES/VRF/cold material is passed only to the fenced forge handoff (forge_one_from_recovered) and NEVER
  copied into the GREEN CoordinatorState, the planner, any node/loop state, or any persisted/logged/
  hashed-for-evidence/replay surface. The forge base is the SAME single recovered BootstrapState that
  seeds the relay spine (no second bootstrap — CN-NODE-01; the recovered state outlives both the
  ForwardSyncState and the ForgeActivation). pool_id + the genesis public anchors feed coordinator_init.
Rule (CN-NODE-03, ci_check_forge_intent_closed.sh + ci_check_operator_forge_no_secret_leak.sh + ci_check_node_forge_real_cli_ingress.sh):
  ingress is STRICTLY RED-parse → BLUE-structural-validator → canonical-type, reusing the existing loaders +
  (N-F-G-A) the REAL opcert/genesis parsers — NO new BLUE authority, NO parser reimpl, NO plugin/trait seam,
  NO second forge codepath, NO new BLUE crate change. ForgeIntent is the closed two-variant set (no third
  "partial" variant); classify_forge_intent is the sole entry, binding the partial arm by name (no wildcard).
  The N-F-E forge containment gate stays SEMANTICALLY UNCHANGED (still exactly one fenced
  forge_one_from_recovered; no run_real_forge / serve / admit / gossip / broadcast / block-fetch / durable-tip
  mutation) — N-F-F/N-F-G-A/N-F-G-B/N-F-G-C may ADD ingress / fidelity / handoff / live-feed gates but MUST NOT
  relax forge containment.
HONEST SCOPE: this is operator-key INGRESS + activation wiring + (N-F-G-A) real config ingress — it makes the
  binary forge-CAPABLE with real keys + real constants. N-F-G-C makes the On arm live-feed-wireable (--peer);
  with a live feed the forge becomes observable at a due leader slot, but peer ACCEPT stays operator-gated
  (RO-LIVE-01). On the empty-source binary path the loop still halts before any ForgeTick. NO serve / admit /
  gossip / durable-tip / BA-02 / RO-LIVE acceptance claim. Mithril is untouched (bootstrap accelerator, NOT a
  forge/validation shortcut).
```

### Surface: --mode node relay run-loop (the live-run owner, N-F-D; forge-tick N-F-E; forge-on flip N-F-F; checked clock + off-epoch guard N-F-G-A; self-accept→serve handoff N-F-G-B; live feed N-F-G-C)

```
Surface: --mode node relay run loop (RED ade_node::node_lifecycle::run_relay_loop; the single live-run owner)
Reduces to: per-iteration step over the closed GREEN LoopStep vocabulary; the tip advances ONLY via run_node_sync → pump_block
Pipeline (fixed; GREEN plans the iteration, RED performs effects, BLUE authority stays behind the seams):
  0. (entry) both --mode node arms converge here     (FirstRun bootstrap + WarmStart recovery → run_relay_loop; no print-and-exit. N-F-F: the arm classifies forge intent FIRST — Off ⇒ forge:None; On ⇒ forge:Some(operator-material ForgeActivation with N-F-G-A current pparams + protocol_version); PartialKeySet ⇒ fail closed. N-F-G-C: the source is a LIVE NodeBlockSource::WirePump (spawn_live_wire_pump_source) when --peer is supplied, else the empty in_memory source)
  1. (top of iteration) reset pending_slot = None     (N-F-E: a skipped/failed path can never forge for a stale slot)
  1a. (forge-on path only) clock seam → SlotNo         (N-F-E: RED Clock::next_tick → millis_to_slot → SlotNo; N-F-G-A S3: now via checked_millis_to_slot — a before-anchor tick fails closed SlotAlignmentError::BeforeGenesisAnchor instead of saturating to start_slot; only SlotNo crosses; DC-NODE-03/DC-NODE-05)
  1b. (forge-on path only) forge_slot_status guard      (N-F-E: GREEN pure monotonic guard → ForgeSlotStatus {Due|NotDue}; at most once per SlotNo, never a past slot)
  2. GREEN plan_loop_step(loop_state, sync_status, forge_slot_status, shutdown)  (→ closed LoopStep {SyncOnce | ForgeTick | Idle | HaltCleanly}; content-blind; total table)
  3a. SyncOnce  → run_node_sync → pump_block            (DC-SYNC-01/DC-SYNC-02: the SOLE durable tip-advance; durable-before-advance; UNMODIFIED since N-F-C; N-F-G-C feeds it from the LIVE WirePump source)
  3b. ForgeTick → exactly one forge_one_from_recovered  (N-F-E: reuses kes_period_for_slot; N-F-G-A S4: forge_epoch_admission runs BEFORE query_leader_schedule — an off-epoch slot fails closed before leadership/KES signing; recovered-surface leadership; advances NO durable tip; serves/admits/gossips NOTHING in the loop body; updates last_forged_slot only on a real attempt; records into in-memory hermetic_forge_outcomes)
  3b'. (N-F-G-B) forge_one_from_recovered now returns (CoordinatorEvent, Option<SelfAcceptedHandoff>)  (RED — Some iff ForgeSucceeded; the loop does a best-effort TYPED tx.send(h) to the sibling served-chain admit task — a typed channel send ONLY; the loop body holds ONLY the mpsc Sender, never a ServedChainHandle / push_atomic / served_chain_admit, so ci_check_node_run_loop_containment.sh stays byte-unchanged)
  3c. Idle      → cancellation-safe wait                (select on source-readiness or shutdown; the only branch that awaits across a cancellation boundary)
  3d. HaltCleanly → exit, on-disk state recoverable
Cross-surface state sharing: shares the persistent ChainDb + FileWalStore with the forward-sync pump +
  warm-start restore; ForgeActivation borrows the recovered BootstrapState (the SOLE leadership source),
  the CoordinatorState (genesis-anchor host for the REUSED kes_period_for_slot), the ProducerShell
  (key custody — hermetic/fenced at N-F-E; REAL operator material at N-F-F; current pparams/protocol_version
  at N-F-G-A), and the Clock seam (checked at N-F-G-A). The forge tick shares NO served-chain / outbound map
  IN THE LOOP BODY. N-F-G-B: ForgeActivation gains an opt-in handoff_tx: Option<mpsc::UnboundedSender<
  SelfAcceptedHandoff>> (set via with_handoff_sender); the dispatcher On arm tokio::spawns a SIBLING served-chain
  admit task that drains the typed channel and admits via the single ServedChainHandle::push_atomic(into_accepted())
  — the served-chain mutation lives in the SIBLING task, NEVER in the loop body. N-F-G-C: the source handed in is
  a LIVE NodeBlockSource::WirePump fed by spawn_live_wire_pump_source (reusing the closed admission dial + pump)
  when --peer is supplied — the SAME N2N inbound surface; the source is still the closed 2-variant enum (a fill,
  not a new variant); the durable tip still advances ONLY via run_node_sync → pump_block.
Rule (CN-NODE-02 / DC-SYNC-02 / DC-NODE-05 / DC-EPOCH-03 / DC-NODE-06, ci_check_node_run_loop_containment.sh + ci_check_loop_planner_closed.sh + ci_check_node_forge_single_epoch_fail_closed.sh + ci_check_served_chain_handoff_fence.sh):

  fenced forge_one_from_recovered( call (CE-E-4). The GREEN planner emits only the closed LoopStep
  vocabulary and cannot express an authority decision; SlotNo is observable ONLY in the pure
  forge_slot_status guard (banned in plan_loop_step). N-F-G-A: the forge tick derives its slot via the checked
  guard (before-anchor fail-closed) and fails an off-epoch slot closed (before leadership) — run_relay_loop's
  body containment is SEMANTICALLY UNCHANGED (the new boundaries sit inside the existing fence). N-F-G-B: the
  loop body forwards the surfaced Option<SelfAcceptedHandoff> as a TYPED mpsc tx.send(h) ONLY — the served-chain
  push_atomic / served_chain_admit live in the SIBLING task, so the loop body still references NO serve token and
  ci_check_node_run_loop_containment.sh is byte-/semantically UNCHANGED. N-F-G-C: the live feed enters as the
  closed NodeBlockSource handed to run_relay_loop (a from_wire_pump FILL) — the run loop body is UNCHANGED (the
  source-selection happens in the dispatcher before the loop); ci_check_node_run_loop_containment.sh is
  byte-unchanged. The sibling serve ingress is fenced by the BROADENED ci_check_served_chain_handoff_fence.sh
  (owners {node_lifecycle.rs, node_sync.rs}; guard-3 allow-list: every node-spine unbounded handoff channel
  MUST carry SelfAcceptedHandoff; every push_atomic( fed by into_accepted(); no direct served_chain_admit().
HONEST SCOPE: N-F-G-C wires the MECHANICAL live feed; the binary is forge-CAPABLE with real keys + real
  constants, and with a LIVE --peer feed the forge becomes observable at a due leader slot — but peer ACCEPT is
  operator-gated (RO-LIVE-01 partial). With no --peer the empty source halts before any ForgeTick. No BA-02 /
  serve-to-peer / gossip / durable-forge claim.

### Surface: --mode node self-accept→serve handoff (the typed handoff seam, N-F-G-B)

```
Surface: self-accept→serve handoff on the --mode node spine (GREEN ade_runtime::producer::self_accepted_handoff::SelfAcceptedHandoff + RED ade_node::{node_sync::forge_one_from_recovered, node_lifecycle sibling serve task})
Reduces to: a BLUE self-accepted AcceptedBlock (the ORIGINAL token from self_accept) → typed SelfAcceptedHandoff carrier → typed mpsc<SelfAcceptedHandoff> channel send → sibling task → the single ServedChainHandle::push_atomic(into_accepted())
Pipeline (fixed; the forge SURFACES the BLUE token, the loop FORWARDS a typed channel send, the SIBLING admits via the single push_atomic — the loop body never mutates the served chain):
  1. BLUE self_accept                                  (inside run_real_forge — the gate; no ForgeSucceeded without an Accepted AcceptedBlock; CN-PROD-04)
  2. run_real_forge → (CoordinatorEvent, Option<AcceptedBlock>)  (RED — thin wrapper + byte-identical run_real_forge_inner writes the BLUE token into the out-param ONLY on success; Some iff ForgeSucceeded; every fail-closed branch None; the closed CoordinatorEvent surface is UNCHANGED — no new variant)
  3. forge_one_from_recovered → (CoordinatorEvent, Option<SelfAcceptedHandoff>)  (RED — wraps via self_accepted.map(SelfAcceptedHandoff::from_self_accepted); the ORIGINAL token, NEVER re-derived from artifact.bytes — CN-FORGE-01)
  4. relay-loop body: best-effort tx.send(h)           (RED node_lifecycle — a TYPED channel send only; the loop holds ONLY the Sender — never a ServedChainHandle, never push_atomic, never a served-chain mutation; ci_check_node_run_loop_containment.sh stays byte-unchanged)
  5. sibling served-chain admit task (tokio::spawn)    (RED node_lifecycle On arm — drains the typed mpsc<SelfAcceptedHandoff> and calls the SINGLE node-spine ServedChainHandle::push_atomic(handoff.into_accepted()))
  6. BLUE served_chain_admit (inside push_atomic)      (the SOLE entry into the served index; only self-accepted blocks — CN-PROD-04; push_atomic wraps it in watch::Sender::send_modify, no torn snapshot)
Cross-surface state sharing: the ServedChainHandle is the SAME single served-admit authority the produce-mode
  forge→serve path uses (CN-PROD-04 / N-R-B/N-T); the served chain is mutated ONLY via push_atomic. The handoff
  carrier wraps the SAME BLUE AcceptedBlock minted by self_accept. N-F-G-C: a self-accepted forged block is now
  served byte-identically over IN-PROCESS block-fetch on the live-feed path
  (live_feed_forge_serve_loopback_returns_forged_block); a served block leaving the node OVER THE WIRE to a peer
  that ACCEPTS it is the operator-gated RO-LIVE-01 leg.
Rule (DC-NODE-06, ci_check_served_chain_handoff_fence.sh [BROADENED, G-C] + ci_check_node_run_loop_containment.sh):
  (1) every node-spine push_atomic( is fed by into_accepted(); (2) NO direct served_chain_admit( on the node
  spine (served-chain mutation only via the single push_atomic); (3) [G-C ALLOW-LIST] every node-spine unbounded
  handoff channel MUST carry SelfAcceptedHandoff (never <Vec<u8>> / <ForgedBlockArtifact> / <bool>), and at least
  one UnboundedSender<SelfAcceptedHandoff> must be present. SelfAcceptedHandoff's SOLE constructor takes a BLUE
  AcceptedBlock (private field) — there is NO raw-bytes / artifact / event / flag / verdict constructor, so a
  non-self-accepted artifact is type-unrepresentable as a handoff. The token is the ORIGINAL from self_accept
  (CN-FORGE-01), never re-derived from artifact.bytes. The relay-loop body forwards a TYPED channel send only —
  ci_check_node_run_loop_containment.sh is byte-/semantically UNCHANGED.
HONEST SCOPE: this is SERVE-AUTHORITY (G-B); N-F-G-C adds the LIVE FEED around it. NO peer-acceptance / BA-02 /
  RO-LIVE acceptance claim (peer ACCEPT stays operator-gated; RO-LIVE-01 partial). BA-02 satisfied nowhere.
```

### Surface: producer-mode forge → serve → broadcast (the live producer half)

```
Surface: --mode produce slot loop (RED ade_node::produce_mode + GREEN producer::coordinator)
Reduces to: ForgedBlock → AcceptedBlock (BLUE self_accept) → ServedChainSnapshot → tag-24-wrapped wire bytes
Pipeline (fixed; the BLUE-then-RED-then-BLUE composition of run_real_forge):
  1. bootstrap_initial_state                        (RED/GREEN — sole forge-state source; N-T; fronts genesis/Mithril cold-start, N-Y/N-Z; produce_mode passes SeedEpochConsensusSource::NotRequired — N-F-A)
  1a. era guard (N-W)                                (RED — non-Praos era fail-closes to ForgeFailureReason::UnsupportedProducerEra before any forge)
  2. RED vrf_prove over expected_vrf_input.alpha_bytes()  (operator VRF key; alpha comes from the BLUE LeaderScheduleAnswer — no RED-side era dispatch; N-W)
  3. BLUE verify_and_evaluate_leader(era, …) → LeaderCheckVerdict  (ade_core::consensus::leader_check; era-correct Praos construction; N-R-A + N-W)
  4. RED kes_sign_header(UnsignedHeaderPreImage)    (signs ONLY the branded pre-image; N-S-A)
  5. GREEN assemble_tick
  6. BLUE forge_block → encode_block_envelope       (single canonical block encoder, storage-form [era, block]; N-V)
  7. BLUE self_accept                               (gate — no ForgeSucceeded without Accepted; N-F-G-B: run_real_forge now SURFACES this original BLUE AcceptedBlock token as the .1 of (CoordinatorEvent, Option<AcceptedBlock>) — Some iff ForgeSucceeded — never re-derived from artifact.bytes; the produce_mode BroadcastBlock caller takes .0 and is functionally unaffected)
  8. ChainEvolution::advance(self)                  (GREEN linear typestate; token only via self_accept; N-T)
  9. ServedChainHandle::push_atomic                 (single served-admit authority; N-R-B/N-T)
 10. BLUE serve composition (N-X)                   (block_fetch::server emits compose_blockfetch_block(storage [era, block]) = tag24(bytes([era, block]));
                                                     chain_sync::server emits compose_rollforward_header(era, header_cbor) = [era_tag, tag24(bytes(header_cbor))])
 11. OutboundCommand → MuxPump                      (typed relay; no byte tunnel; N-S-B)
Cross-surface state sharing: ChainEvolution threads each forge's post-state into the next
  forge's base; ServedChainSnapshot is shared with the N2N serve path; the per-peer outbound
  map is shared with the listener. The serve step's tag-24 wrap is the SAME ade_codec authority
  the receive path uses to unwrap (CN-WIRE-08). produce_mode's KES/VRF/cold/opcert loaders are
  the SAME loaders reused by the N-F-F operator-forge ingress (no reimpl). N-F-G-B: run_real_forge's
  surfaced BLUE AcceptedBlock is the SAME token the node-spine self-accept→serve handoff (above) wraps into a
  SelfAcceptedHandoff; the ServedChainHandle::push_atomic is the SAME single served-admit authority both paths use.
N-F-A/N-F-C/N-F-E/N-F-F/N-F-G-A fence (populate-side AND consume-side enforced): produce_mode is the forge-time
  consensus-input path (import_live_consensus_inputs + pool_distr_view_from_consensus_inputs +
  --consensus-inputs-path). It MUST pass SeedEpochConsensusSource::NotRequired and MUST NOT build / put
  the seed-epoch sidecar nor append its WAL provenance (CN-CINPUT-02 populate-side). produce_mode stays
  DIAGNOSTIC and does NOT consume the recovered surface. The recovered-surface CONSUME-side seam is
  CLOSED on the SEPARATE node-lifecycle forge path: node_sync::forge_one_from_recovered projects the
  leadership view ONLY via PoolDistrView::from_seed_epoch_consensus_inputs(&recovered.…), and may NOT
  fabricate a SeedEpochConsensusInputs literal or name the bundle tokens
  (ci_check_consensus_input_provenance.sh guard (d); CN-CINPUT-03 / DC-CINPUT-02b). The N-F-E forge tick,
  the N-F-F On arm, and the N-F-G-A current-constants forge tick reach that same fenced forge path from
  the relay loop's ForgeTick branch.
```

### Surface: seed-epoch sidecar warm-start (recovered consensus inputs — N-F-A; WIRED in N-F-C)

```
Surface: warm-start restore of the recovered seed-epoch consensus inputs (RED ade_runtime::bootstrap::restore_seed_epoch_consensus_inputs, inside the bootstrap_initial_state authority)
Reduces to: anchor-fp-keyed sidecar bytes (SnapshotStore::get_seed_epoch_consensus_inputs) → verified SeedEpochConsensusInputs → BootstrapState.seed_epoch_consensus_inputs: Option<SeedEpochConsensusInputs>
Pipeline (fixed; the RED-read / BLUE-verify chain; fail-closed on every step):
  1. SeedEpochConsensusSource discriminant           (RequiredFromRecoveredProvenance(provenance) ⇒ restore; NotRequired ⇒ None — the only two modes; the node-lifecycle WarmStart arm passes RequiredFromRecoveredProvenance; produce_mode + every other caller passes NotRequired)
  2. RED get_seed_epoch_consensus_inputs(anchor_fp)  (the only RED step — reads the anchor-fp-keyed sidecar bytes; absent ⇒ BootstrapError::SeedConsensusSidecarMissing)
  3. BLUE blake2b_256 bind                            (re-hash the read bytes; != provenance.sidecar_hash ⇒ SeedConsensusHashMismatch)
  4. BLUE decode_seed_epoch_consensus_inputs          (the A1 SOLE decoder; version-gated, byte-canonical; failure ⇒ SeedConsensusSidecarDecode)
  5. BLUE anchor/epoch binding                        (decoded anchor_fp/epoch_no != provenance ⇒ SeedConsensusBindingMismatch)
  6. BLUE byte-identity re-encode                     (re-encode != input ⇒ SeedConsensusHashMismatch)
Cross-surface state sharing: the same SnapshotStore + WAL the forward-sync pump, recovery::restart, the
  N-F-C node lifecycle, and the N-F-D relay loop use. The recovered BootstrapState this produces is the
  SOLE leadership source the N-F-E forge tick / N-F-F On-arm / N-F-G-A current-constants tick projects
  (PoolDistrView::from_seed_epoch_consensus_inputs) AND the single forge base (no second bootstrap, CN-NODE-01).
N-F-C WIRING: the production restart path is wired — ade_node::node_lifecycle (--mode node) drives this
  restore on its WarmStart arm via list_seed_epoch_consensus_anchor_fps discovery → WAL replay →
  bootstrap_initial_state(RequiredFromRecoveredProvenance). The CONSUME-side fence
  (ci_check_consensus_input_provenance.sh guard (d): CN-CINPUT-03 / DC-CINPUT-02b) keeps the forge path
  from fabricating the record. N-F-G-A note: the recovered ledger now also carries the oracle-bound CURRENT
  ProtocolParameters (installed at seed/import, S2a) — warm-start preserves it. N-F-G-C note: the recovered tip
  this produces is the start_point spawn_live_wire_pump_source dials from (Point::Block) on the live-feed path.
```

### Surface: --mode node lifecycle (FirstRun / WarmStart — the real Ade node, N-F-C)

```
Surface: --mode node (RED ade_node::node_lifecycle; THE single PHASE4-N-F-C-LIFECYCLE-OWNER)
Reduces to: on-disk state → closed NodeStart {FirstRun | WarmStart} → verified BootstrapState through the single bootstrap_initial_state authority → forge-intent classify (N-F-F) → source select (N-F-G-C) → run_relay_loop (N-F-D)
Pipeline (fixed; classification is a PURE function of on-disk state):
  1. open persistent ChainDb (PersistentChainDb) + FileWalStore
  2. classify_start(has_tip, has_snapshots)            (pure → NodeStart::FirstRun | NodeStart::WarmStart)
  3a. FirstRun  → first_run_mithril_bootstrap          (Mithril-only; bootstrap_from_mithril_snapshot; verify_mithril_binding fail-closed BEFORE any state admitted; persists seed-epoch sidecar + WAL provenance; NO genesis/bundle/cold/graft fallback)
  3b. WarmStart → warm_start_recovery                  (list_seed_epoch_consensus_anchor_fps discovery → WAL replay → bootstrap_initial_state(RequiredFromRecoveredProvenance) verify chain)
  4. (N-F-F) classify_forge_intent over flag presence  (Off ⇒ forge:None; On(paths) ⇒ build_operator_forge_material → coordinator_init → ForgeActivation → forge:Some; PartialKeySet ⇒ NodeLifecycleError::ForgeKeyIngress = exit 44)
  4a. (N-F-G-A) the On-arm ForgeActivation carries current pparams + protocol_version  (from forge_constants_from_pparams; real opcert/genesis ingress; checked clock; off-epoch guard inside forge_one_from_recovered)
  4b. (N-F-G-C) source select  (--peer present ⇒ spawn_live_wire_pump_source → LIVE NodeBlockSource::WirePump via from_wire_pump, reusing the closed admission dial + pump; else NodeBlockSource::in_memory(Vec::new()) — the empty source)
  5. (N-F-D) both arms converge into run_relay_loop    (the single live-run owner; the tip advances ONLY via run_node_sync → pump_block; N-F-F: forge:None on the default binary path, forge:Some on the operator-key On arm; N-F-G-C: the chosen source is handed in)
Cross-surface state sharing: shares the single bootstrap_initial_state authority with produce_mode +
  the Conway-genesis + Mithril production-bootstrap paths; shares the persistent ChainDb + FileWalStore
  with the forward-sync pump + warm-start restore + the relay loop. The recovered BootstrapState is BOTH
  the spine base AND (On arm) the forge base — one recovered state, no second bootstrap. N-F-G-C: the live
  feed reuses the SAME admission dial + pump the wire-only / admission modes use (no reimpl). Closed fail-closed
  NodeLifecycleError (incl. RelaySync, N-F-D; ForgeKeyIngress, N-F-F; MissingFlag("--network-magic") on the
  live-feed arm, N-F-G-C).
Rule (CN-NODE-01, ci_check_lifecycle_owner_uses_bootstrap_initial_state.sh + ci_check_node_binary_uses_single_bootstrap.sh):
  exactly one module carries the PHASE4-N-F-C-LIFECYCLE-OWNER marker; both arms route through the SINGLE
  bootstrap_initial_state authority — no second bootstrap/recovery/storage-init path, no genesis/bundle/cold/
  graft fallback, no recover_node_state overclaim. ReceiveState::new is legitimate only in the lifecycle-owner
  files {node.rs, node_lifecycle.rs} (N-F-F owner allow-list). A new mode that needs initial state MUST obtain
  it via this one authority. The N-F-F On arm reuses the SAME recovered state as the forge base; N-F-G-C's live
  feed introduces NO second bootstrap (the tip still advances only via run_node_sync → pump_block).
```

### Surface: --mode node sync source (verdict-decoupled peer-block source, N-F-C; readiness extended N-F-D; LIVE WirePump fill N-F-G-C)

```
Surface: NodeBlockSource (RED ade_node::node_sync; closed 2-variant enum {WirePump | InMemory})
Reduces to: ordered peer-block BYTES only (AdmissionPeerEvent::Block → Vec<u8>); NEVER a verdict
Pipeline (the verdict-decoupled source contract, E1/E2; N-F-D readiness signal; N-F-G-C live fill):
  1. next_block() selects ONLY AdmissionPeerEvent::Block, in arrival order
  1a. AdmissionPeerEvent::TipUpdate is SKIPPED            (a comparison input for admission's verdict loop, not a block, not a sync tip authority)
  1b. AdmissionPeerEvent::Disconnected / closed channel ENDS the feed (a clean disconnect is not a tip authority)
  1c. (N-F-D) content-blind readiness                     (has_work_ready / is_ended / wait_ready via non-blocking try_recv; next_block is non-blocking drain-then-None; never awaited across a shutdown cancellation boundary; the WirePump arm fills an opaque content-blind lookahead VecDeque<Vec<u8>> from the channel)
  1d. (N-F-G-C) from_wire_pump(rx: mpsc::Receiver<AdmissionPeerEvent>)  (the LIVE constructor of the WirePump arm — fed by spawn_live_wire_pump_source reusing the closed admission dial + pump; a FILL of the existing arm, NOT a new variant)
  2. (driver) run_node_sync feeds bytes to forward_sync::pump_block — its production caller — durable StoreBlockBytes + AppendWal BEFORE AdvanceTip (DC-SYNC-01), then a tip checkpoint via PersistentSnapshotCache
Cross-surface state sharing: the same persistent ChainDb + FileWalStore the lifecycle owner + warm-start
  restore + the relay loop use; the captured tip checkpoint is the exact PersistentSnapshotCache artifact warm_start_recovery reads back.
Rule (DC-SYNC-01 / DC-SYNC-02, ci_check_node_sync_via_pump.sh): the source yields ordered block bytes and
  NOTHING else (no derive_verdict / run_admission / follow); run_node_sync advances the tip ONLY via
  pump_block (no follower-as-sync, no verdict-as-sync, no manual put_block/AdvanceTip/rollback_to_slot).
  run_node_sync is UNMODIFIED in production by N-F-D / N-F-E / N-F-F / N-F-G-A / N-F-G-C (#[cfg(test)] additions
  + N-F-G-A's forge_epoch_admission GREEN-by-fn guard; N-F-G-C added the from_wire_pump constructor + the
  live_wire_pump_feed_reaches_forge_tick reachability test). The WirePump arm stays a closed verdict-decoupled
  contract — a FILL from a LIVE dial, NOT a plugin point for alternative sources.
HONEST SCOPE: run_node_sync is driven on the live run path ONLY by the N-F-D relay loop (SyncOnce);
  forge_one_from_recovered is reached ONLY via the N-F-E ForgeTick branch when a ForgeActivation is
  supplied. N-F-G-C: with --peer, the WirePump arm is fed a LIVE unbounded cardano-node peer (the prior
  RO-LIVE-01 feed-side follow-on, now wired); with no --peer the empty source halts before any SyncOnce/ForgeTick.
  Peer ACCEPT stays operator-gated (RO-LIVE-01 partial).
```

### Surface: BA-02 peer-acceptance evidence (GREEN correlator N-F-C; RED file I/O wired N-F-G-C)

```
Surface: operator-captured peer-accept JSONL log (GREEN ade_node::ba02_evidence::parse_peer_accept_events; RED file I/O ade_node::ba02_pass, N-F-G-C)
Reduces to: closed PeerAcceptEvent set → BA02Outcome {Ba02Manifest | NoEvidence} via correlate
Pipeline (allow-list parse → exact-match correlate; the SOLE Ba02Manifest constructor):
  1. (N-F-G-C) ba02_pass::correlate_peer_log_file       (RED — std::fs read of the operator-captured file; a missing/unreadable file ⇒ io::Error fail-closed, NEVER a synthesized acceptance)
  2. parse_peer_accept_events                            (GREEN ALLOW-LIST: only `peer_served_block` / `peer_chain_tip` discriminators → PeerAcceptEvent; every weaker/unknown/malformed line DROPPED, never coerced)
  3. AdeForgeRecord::from_forge_artifact                 (reads the BLUE-minted forged hash + slot VERBATIM from ForgedBlockArtifact — NEVER recomputed; no new BLUE authority)
  4. correlate(ade, peer_log)                            (GREEN pure/total/deterministic, HASH-PRIMARY; emits BA02Outcome::Ba02Manifest ONLY on an exact forged-hash↔peer-accept match at the matching chain point, no conflicting signal; else NoEvidence{reason})
  5. (N-F-G-C) ba02_pass::write_ba02_manifest            (RED — accepts ONLY a Ba02Manifest, so a written manifest is ALWAYS correlate-produced — no path emits one from NoEvidence or raw operator input)
Cross-surface state sharing: NONE. GREEN evidence comparing already-authoritative outputs; ba02_pass is RED file
  I/O ONLY (constructs no evidence, derives no acceptance, never coerces a non-acceptance line). A Ba02Manifest is
  a CLAIM ABOUT authority, not authority.
Rule (RO-LIVE-06 / CN-OPERATOR-EVIDENCE-01, ci_check_ba02_evidence_closed.sh + ci_check_ba02_evidence_manifest_schema.sh):
  correlate is the ONLY Ba02Manifest constructor; write_ba02_manifest accepts ONLY a Ba02Manifest; NO self-evidence
  token (ForgeSucceeded / self_accept / block_received / served-block / wire-success / agreement_verdict / "agreed")
  may be an acceptance source; NO committed synthetic *ba02* manifest. The new schema gate (8 fields +
  schema_version == 1 + peer_log_file_sha256 cross-check) is vacuous-until-committed. The versioned Ba02Manifest
  (BA02_MANIFEST_SCHEMA_VERSION = 1) is a version-GATED contract (§4).
HONEST SCOPE: G-C wires the RED file I/O (ba02_pass) over the UNCHANGED GREEN correlator, reached by NO binary arm
  at this HEAD (tested only). Synthetic logs prove the mechanics only and CANNOT satisfy BA-02. BA-02 is satisfied
  NOWHERE at this HEAD (incl. N-F-G-C's live-feed scaffolding); RO-LIVE-01 remains partial/operator-gated — a real
  BA-02 result needs an operator-captured peer log through correlate against a peer that can grant leadership
  (C1 private testnet or C2 preprod with provisioned stake).
```

### Surface: operator file ingress (KES skey / opcert / Shelley genesis / UTxO seed dump)

```
Surface: operator-supplied files (RED ade_runtime::producer::{keys, opcert_envelope, genesis_parser}, seed_import)
Reduces to: Sum6Kes signing key (via BLUE deserializer) / OperationalCert / GenesisAnchor / canonical seed entries
Pipeline:
  1. RED parse text/JSON/CBOR envelope               (closed parser per file type; structured fail-closed error)
  2. BLUE structural validator                       (e.g. Sum6Kes::raw_deserialize_signing_key_kes — byte layout is the validator)
  3. canonical type handed to the BLUE core          (never raw bytes)
Cross-surface state sharing: GenesisAnchor + opcert public metadata feed the producer coordinator;
  KES/VRF/cold private material is RED-confined and never enters GREEN CoordinatorState.
N-F-F note (CLOSED — was the prior §7 candidate #1): --mode node NOW ingests real operator keys. The
  ingress is a NEW dedicated surface (ade_node::operator_forge, see the operator-key-ingress surface above)
  that REUSES these exact loaders (load_cold_signing_key_skey / load_vrf_signing_key_skey /
  load_kes_skey_any_format) in a RED-parse → BLUE-structural-validate → canonical-type pipeline — no new
  BLUE authority, no parser reimpl, no plugin seam. Key custody stays RED-confined to ProducerShell
  (OperatorForgeMaterial not Debug/Serialize; no byte accessor / serialization / logging). The forge-on flip
  is opt-in via operator-key flag presence (CN-NODE-03).
N-F-G-A note: on the --mode node path the operator_forge ingress now uses the REAL parse_opcert_envelope +
  parse_shelley_genesis (the parse_simple_* stubs are RETIRED there) — same RED-parse → BLUE-validate pipeline,
  no new BLUE authority (ci_check_node_forge_real_cli_ingress.sh). The cardano-cli query protocol-parameters
  JSON is a NEW operator-sourced preimage (carried in the consensus-inputs bundle) parsed by the GREEN
  consensus_inputs::protocol_params parser into the canonical BLUE ProtocolParameters (no float).
N-F-G-C note: a NEW operator-supplied INPUT enters here — the operator-captured peer-accept JSONL log, read by
  the RED ba02_pass::correlate_peer_log_file and reduced through the GREEN correlate to the closed BA02Outcome
  (see the BA-02 surface above). It is evidence input, never runtime authority; a missing/unreadable file fails
  closed (io::Error). No new wire-feed file type — the live feed reuses the closed admission dial + pump.
```

### Surface: Mithril snapshot manifest — provenance binding (N-Y)

```
Surface: Mithril snapshot manifest JSON (RED ade_runtime::mithril_import::json::parse_mithril_manifest_json)
Reduces to: RawMithrilManifest → SeedProvenance::Mithril{..} + MithrilManifestReport → (BLUE) verify_mithril_binding verdict
Pipeline (fixed; the RED-then-BLUE provenance binding):
  1. RED parse_mithril_manifest_json                 (SOLE manifest-JSON parser → RawMithrilManifest; fail-closed MithrilManifestError; NO semantic decision)
  2. RED import_mithril_manifest                     (maps into the closed SeedProvenance::Mithril + MithrilManifestReport; NEVER re-verifies the STM multisig)
  3. BLUE verify_mithril_binding(report, anchor)     (the SOLE authority deciding whether a Mithril anchor binds; cross-checks {network_magic, genesis_hash, certified_point, certificate_hash}; fails closed with MithrilImportError)
Cross-surface state sharing: the report side (manifest) and the anchor side MUST originate
  independently — verify_mithril_binding is NOT a tautological self-check (CN-MITHRIL-01).
N-F-F/N-F-G-A/N-F-G-C note: Mithril is UNTOUCHED — it stays the bootstrap/recovery layer (a bootstrap
  accelerator), NOT a validation/forge shortcut. The operator-key ingress + the live feed do NOT call Mithril
  and do NOT create a second bootstrap path (CN-NODE-01; the forge base is the single recovered BootstrapState).
```

### Surface: Mithril production-bootstrap composition (N-Z, extended N-F-A sidecar tail; first non-test caller N-F-C)

```
Surface: bootstrap_from_mithril_snapshot (RED ade_runtime::mithril_bootstrap; composition-only — NO standalone argv flag; N-F-C first non-test caller = the --mode node FirstRun arm)
Reduces to: (MithrilSeedPointInputs, seed (LedgerState, PraosChainDepState), manifest_bytes) → MithrilBootstrapOutput { ledger, chain_dep, tip, anchor } (+ N-F-A sidecar put + WAL provenance append)
Pipeline (fixed; the call-order is CI-pinned by ci_check_mithril_seed_point_independence.sh):
  1. RED import_mithril_manifest_from_bytes(manifest_bytes)  (→ MithrilProvenanceImport { provenance, report }; fail-closed MithrilBootstrapError::Import; NO semantic decision)
  2. RED mint(MintInputs{ seed_slot/seed_block_hash/network_magic/genesis_hash/… from MithrilSeedPointInputs (operator-INDEPENDENT origin); seed_provenance = import.provenance })  (→ BootstrapAnchor; seed_point comes ONLY from the operator inputs, NEVER the manifest — DC-MITHRIL-02)
  3. BLUE verify_mithril_binding(&import.report, &anchor)    (the SOLE binding authority; fail-closed MithrilBootstrapError::Binding BEFORE any storage init; CN-MITHRIL-01 strengthened — verify-before-bootstrap)
  4. RED bootstrap_initial_state(BootstrapInputs{ …, genesis_initial: Some((seed_ledger, seed_chain_dep)) , seed_epoch_consensus_source: NotRequired })  (the single closed bootstrap authority; never a parallel storage-init path; CN-NODE-01)
  5. RED sidecar tail (N-F-A; success path only, after binding passes)  (GREEN merge_seed_epoch_consensus_inputs → A1 encode → put_seed_epoch_consensus_inputs(anchor_fp, …) DURABLE → append_seed_epoch_provenance (WAL tag 3) COMMIT POINT; the composer WRITES the sidecar, never consumes one; CN-CINPUT-02)
Cross-surface state sharing: shares the single bootstrap authority with produce_mode + the
  Conway-genesis path + the N-F-C node lifecycle. The operator's MithrilSeedPointInputs origin and the
  manifest origin MUST stay structurally independent (DC-MITHRIL-02). The N-F-A sidecar tail puts to the
  anchor-fp-keyed SnapshotStore namespace (disjoint from the slot-keyed snapshot space) THEN appends WAL
  provenance — a crash between leaves an unrecorded sidecar, which warm-start treats as "not imported"
  and fails closed.
```

### Surface: Conway genesis cold-start (N-Y, extended N-F-A sidecar tail)

```
Surface: Conway genesis config (RED ade_runtime::genesis_bootstrap::bootstrap_from_conway_genesis)
Reduces to: ConwayGenesisConfig → (LedgerState, PraosChainDepState) → BootstrapInputs.genesis_initial (+ N-F-A sidecar put + WAL provenance append)
Pipeline (fixed; the RED-read / BLUE-transform / single-authority composition):
  1. RED genesis_parser file read/parse              (shelley/Conway genesis JSON → ConwayGenesisConfig)
  2. BLUE genesis_initial_state(&ConwayGenesisConfig) (pure Conway-only transform; fail-closed GenesisSourceError::NonConwayEra)
  3. RED route through bootstrap_initial_state       (genesis pair enters ONLY via BootstrapInputs.genesis_initial; records SeedProvenance::CardanoCliJson; seed_epoch_consensus_source: NotRequired; never a second storage-init authority)
  4. RED sidecar tail (N-F-A)                         (GREEN merge → A1 encode → put_seed_epoch_consensus_inputs DURABLE → append_seed_epoch_provenance (WAL tag 3) COMMIT POINT; WRITES the sidecar, never consumes one; CN-CINPUT-02)
Cross-surface state sharing: shares the single bootstrap authority with produce_mode + the
  N-Z Mithril production-bootstrap composition. bootstrap_from_mithril_snapshot is the
  symmetric Mithril-path twin of this entry; both gained the same &mut dyn WalStore + sidecar tail.
  NOTE (N-F-C): the --mode node FirstRun arm is Mithril-ONLY (it routes through
  bootstrap_from_mithril_snapshot, NOT this genesis path — no genesis fallback on the node lifecycle).
  NOTE (N-F-F/N-F-G-A): the operator-key ingress reuses producer::genesis_parser (N-F-G-A: the REAL
  parse_shelley_genesis) for clock/KES ANCHOR EXTRACTION ONLY — NOT a bootstrap source and NOT a new
  semantic genesis authority.
```

### Surface: argv (closed mode set)

```
Surface: command line (RED ade_node::cli — Cli / ProduceCli / AdmissionCli / KeyGenKesCli)
Reduces to: a 5-variant CLOSED Mode enum {wire_only, admission, key_gen_kes, produce, node}
  (Mode::parse; NOT #[non_exhaustive]; main.rs dispatch has NO wildcard arm; ci_check_node_mode_closure.sh)
Pipeline: argv → Cli → mode driver. --mode produce requires --json-seed + --consensus-inputs-path;
  --mode node (N-F-C) requires --snapshot-dir + --wal-dir, and on FirstRun the documented-extraction
  inputs (--json-seed + --consensus-inputs-path + --mithril-manifest-path, Mithril-bound — NEVER forge inputs).
  --mode node (N-F-F) ADDITIONALLY accepts the OPTIONAL operator-key flags (cold/KES/VRF skey + opcert +
  genesis-file) classified by classify_forge_intent over PRESENCE: all five ⇒ forge-on, none ⇒ relay-only,
  any partial ⇒ fail closed (exit 44). --mode node (N-F-G-C) ADDITIONALLY accepts the OPTIONAL --peer flag(s):
  present ⇒ a LIVE NodeBlockSource::WirePump feed (requires --network-magic, else MissingFlag fail-closed);
  absent ⇒ the empty in_memory source (halts before any SyncOnce/ForgeTick).
Cross-surface state sharing: none.
N-F-C: the `node` variant is the addition; main() routes Mode::Node → run_node_lifecycle. Adding a
  Mode variant is a SURFACE REDUCTION (closed taxonomy), not an extension point — a new variant forces a
  main.rs compile error until an explicit (wildcard-free) arm is added (ci_check_node_mode_closure.sh).
N-F-D/N-F-E/N-F-G-A: NO new argv flag for the relay loop / forge tick / forge fidelity. N-F-F: the operator-key
  flags are an OPTIONAL ingress on the existing --mode node arm (no new Mode variant). N-F-G-C: --peer is an
  OPTIONAL live-feed flag on the existing --mode node arm (no new Mode variant) — present ⇒ the forge tick
  becomes reachable in production once a leader slot is due (RO-LIVE-01); absent ⇒ the default empty-source path.
```

**Rule:** New ingress attaches by producing the canonical BLUE type's bytes and entering
the **same** pipeline. A new mini-protocol attaches through `session::core::step` + a BLUE
`*_transition` reducer + a closed `AcceptedMiniProtocol` registry entry. A new operator
file type attaches as a RED parser feeding a BLUE structural validator. **A new bootstrap
seed source (like Mithril or genesis) attaches by populating `BootstrapInputs.genesis_initial`
and routing through the single `bootstrap_initial_state` authority — NEVER via a new
`*Anchor` trait / plugin seam, and never via a parallel storage-init path** (CN-MITHRIL-01 /
CN-NODE-01 / DC-GENESIS-SRC-01 / DC-MITHRIL-02). **A recovered-state surface (like the N-F-A
seed-epoch consensus inputs) is populated ONLY on the verified-bootstrap composition path
(put-then-WAL-append) and is read back ONLY by the warm-start restore inside
`bootstrap_initial_state` — the producer / forge-time path may not populate it (CN-CINPUT-02
populate-side); the CONSUME-side wiring is CLOSED in PHASE4-N-F-C, fenced by
`ci_check_consensus_input_provenance.sh` guard (d) (CN-CINPUT-03 / DC-CINPUT-02b);
`produce_mode` stays diagnostic.** **A new live-run step attaches to the relay loop as a closed
`LoopStep` variant + a content-blind GREEN planner input + a fenced RED branch (N-F-D / N-F-E
pattern) — the planner emits a closed vocabulary and cannot decide authority; the loop body
advances the tip ONLY via `run_node_sync` and (if it forges) reaches EXACTLY ONE fenced
`forge_one_from_recovered`, serving/admitting/gossiping nothing (CN-NODE-02 / DC-NODE-05).**
**A LIVE feed for the `--mode node` spine (N-F-G-C) attaches by REUSING the closed
`ade_runtime::admission::{dial_for_admission, run_admission_wire_pump}` and FILLING the closed
`NodeBlockSource::WirePump` arm via `from_wire_pump` — NEVER a new `NodeBlockSource` variant, a
new wire authority, a reimplemented dial/pump, a second tip-advance, or a verdict; a dial/parse
failure is logged-and-dropped, never fatal / fabricated / a tip graft (the broadened
`ci_check_served_chain_handoff_fence.sh` + the byte-unchanged `ci_check_node_run_loop_containment.sh`).**
**Operator signing-material ingress (N-F-F) attaches as a closed presence-classifier (`forge_intent`,
GREEN) + a single named RED ingress site (`operator_forge`) that REUSES the existing
cold/vrf/kes/opcert loaders — NO new BLUE authority, NO parser reimpl, NO plugin seam, NO second
forge codepath; key custody stays RED-confined to `ProducerShell`.** **A forge-fidelity boundary
(N-F-G-A) attaches INSIDE the existing forge fence — a current-protocol-parameters source as a
GREEN RED-parse → BLUE-`ProtocolParameters` pipeline (no float; hash-bound to the fingerprinted
`protocol_params_hash`; the preimage carried OUTSIDE the frozen 15-field fingerprint), a checked
clock→slot guard that fails closed before-anchor (never saturates), and an off-epoch guard derived
via the BLUE `EraSchedule::locate` that fails the forge closed before leadership — each a closed
fail-closed surface, NOT a new extension point or a new BLUE authority; `run_relay_loop`'s
containment stays SEMANTICALLY UNCHANGED (DC-EPOCH-03 — `ci_check_recovered_ledger_pparams_sourced.sh`
+ `ci_check_node_forge_real_cli_ingress.sh` + `ci_check_node_forge_single_epoch_fail_closed.sh` +
`ci_check_genesis_consistency_fixture_present.sh`).** **A self-accept→serve handoff (N-F-G-B) attaches
ONLY through the constructor-fenced `SelfAcceptedHandoff` carrier (sole ctor `from_self_accepted`,
no raw-bytes/artifact/event/flag/verdict ctor) into a sibling served-chain admit task whose sole
mutation is the single `ServedChainHandle::push_atomic` fed by `into_accepted()`; the relay-loop body
forwards a typed `mpsc<SelfAcceptedHandoff>` send only (DC-NODE-06 / CN-PROD-04 /
`ci_check_served_chain_handoff_fence.sh`).** **BA-02 evidence I/O (N-F-G-C) attaches as RED file I/O
(`ba02_pass`) over the UNCHANGED GREEN `correlate` — `correlate` stays the SOLE `Ba02Manifest`
constructor; `write_ba02_manifest` accepts ONLY a `Ba02Manifest`; no self-evidence acceptance source;
no committed synthetic manifest (RO-LIVE-06 / CN-OPERATOR-EVIDENCE-01 —
`ci_check_ba02_evidence_manifest_schema.sh`, vacuous-until-committed + sha256-bound).** A new `--mode`
that needs initial state MUST obtain it via the single `bootstrap_initial_state` authority (CN-NODE-01).
New ingress **may not** introduce a second `PreservedCbor` construction site, a second
block-envelope encoder, a second era→leader-VRF-input construction (CN-FORGE-04), a second
`wrap_tag24` / `unwrap_tag24` definition or a hand-rolled tag-24 parse in RED (CN-WIRE-08), a
direct-transport write that bypasses `OutboundCommand`, a forward-sync path that advances the tip
before the durability writes ack (DC-SYNC-01), a second bootstrap/storage-init authority
(CN-NODE-01 / DC-GENESIS-SRC-01), a Mithril manifest parser other than `parse_mithril_manifest_json`
(CN-MITHRIL-01), a Mithril-bootstrap composition that drills into the manifest import to source the
anchor `seed_point` (DC-MITHRIL-02), a second `SeedEpochConsensusInputs` codec (CN-CINPUT-01), a
forge-time path that populates the seed-epoch sidecar / appends its WAL provenance (CN-CINPUT-02), a
`Mode` enum variant without an explicit wildcard-free `main.rs` dispatch arm (CN-NODE-MODE-01), a
second `--mode node` lifecycle owner or a lifecycle arm bypassing `bootstrap_initial_state`
(CN-NODE-01), a node-sync driver that advances the tip by any path other than `pump_block`
(DC-SYNC-01), a second `NodeBlockSource` variant / a reimplemented dial-pump / a live feed that
advances a second tip (N-F-G-C — `from_wire_pump` is a FILL of the closed `WirePump` arm; the dial +
pump are REUSED verbatim), a second `Ba02Manifest` constructor / a self-evidence acceptance source / a
committed synthetic BA-02 manifest (RO-LIVE-06), a second live-run owner or a relay-loop body that
advances the tip / forges / serves / admits / gossips outside the closed seams (CN-NODE-02 /
DC-SYNC-02), a GREEN planner that observes a `SlotNo` in `plan_loop_step` or emits a non-closed
`LoopStep` (DC-NODE-05), a node-lifecycle forge path that fabricates a `SeedEpochConsensusInputs`
literal or names a forge-time bundle token (CN-CINPUT-03 / DC-CINPUT-02b), a second operator-material
ingress site / a third `ForgeIntent` variant / a partial-key-set silent relay fallback / private
KES-VRF-cold bytes escaping `ProducerShell` (CN-NODE-03), a node-spine served-chain mutation outside
the single `push_atomic` fed by `into_accepted()` / a handoff channel typed other than
`UnboundedSender<SelfAcceptedHandoff>` (DC-NODE-06), **a `parse_simple_*` parser reintroduced on the
`--mode node` forge path (CE-G-A-2 — `ci_check_node_forge_real_cli_ingress.sh`), a recovered ledger
carrying `ProtocolParameters::default()` / genesis-initial pparams instead of the oracle preimage
(CE-G-A-2a — `ci_check_recovered_ledger_pparams_sourced.sh`), a `forge_epoch_admission` guard reordered
AFTER `query_leader_schedule` / a fabricated candidate epoch / a `NonceInput::EpochBoundary`|`CandidateFreeze`
nonce promotion on the forge path (DC-EPOCH-03 — `ci_check_node_forge_single_epoch_fail_closed.sh`), a
`protocol_params` float path, a `checked_millis_to_slot` that saturates a before-anchor tick, or a
`protocol_params_json` preimage folded INTO the 15-field canonical fingerprint (CE-G-A-1/2/2a/4).**

## 2. Data-Only vs. Authoritative Layers

### Domain: live `--mode node` block feed — REUSED dial/pump vs. closed source (RED reuse / closed fill; N-F-G-C)

| Layer | Module | Color | Role |
|-------|--------|-------|------|
| **Live-feed wiring (REUSE, no reimpl)** | `ade_node::node_lifecycle::spawn_live_wire_pump_source` (NEW, S1) | RED | Builds a LIVE `NodeBlockSource::WirePump` from the operator-supplied `--peer`. REUSES the closed `ade_runtime::admission::{dial_for_admission, run_admission_wire_pump}` VERBATIM (no reimplementation, no new wire authority) + the `pub(crate)`-promoted `build_n2n_version_table`. Each peer dialed in a `tokio::spawn` → bounded `mpsc` (`LIVE_WIRE_PUMP_CHANNEL_CAP = 64`) → `from_wire_pump(rx)`. A dial/parse failure is logged-and-dropped (C3). Decides nothing; moves bytes from a reused dial into a closed source. |
| **Reused dial authority** | `ade_runtime::admission::dial_for_admission` | RED | The SAME admission dial the wire-only / admission modes use — REUSED verbatim. UNCHANGED. |
| **Reused wire pump** | `ade_runtime::admission::run_admission_wire_pump` | RED | The SAME admission wire pump — REUSED verbatim; emits `AdmissionPeerEvent`. UNCHANGED. |
| **Closed verdict-decoupled source (FILL, not a new variant)** | `ade_node::node_sync::NodeBlockSource` (`from_wire_pump`, closed 2-variant `{WirePump, InMemory}`) | RED | The `WirePump` arm is FILLED from the live `AdmissionPeerEvent` channel; yields ordered `Block` bytes ONLY, skips `TipUpdate`, ends on `Disconnected`. NEVER a verdict. A FILL of the existing arm, NOT a new variant. |
| **Authoritative durable apply (UNMODIFIED)** | `ade_runtime::forward_sync::pump_block` (via `node_sync::run_node_sync`) | RED + BLUE admit | The SOLE durable tip-advance the live bytes feed; `StoreBlockBytes`/`AppendWal`-before-`AdvanceTip` (DC-SYNC-01). UNMODIFIED — no second tip-advance. |

**Rule (N-F-G-C live feed; `ci_check_served_chain_handoff_fence.sh` BROADENED + `ci_check_node_run_loop_containment.sh`
byte-unchanged):** the live feed is **REUSE, not reimplementation** — the dial + pump are the closed admission
authorities, reused verbatim; `build_n2n_version_table` is reused via a fn-visibility promotion. The source stays
the **closed 2-variant `NodeBlockSource`** — `from_wire_pump` is a FILL of the existing `WirePump` arm, **NOT a
new variant / plugin point / new wire authority**. The durable tip advances ONLY via `run_node_sync → pump_block`
(no second tip-advance). A dial/parse failure is logged-and-dropped — never fatal / fabricated / a tip graft.
**None of these chokepoints move.** **Honest scope:** G-C wires the MECHANICAL live feed ONLY — with a live feed
the forge is observable at a due leader slot, but **peer ACCEPT is operator-gated** (RO-LIVE-01 partial), proven
only by an operator-captured peer log through `correlate`. Ade self-accept / served-block / wire success ≠ peer
acceptance. BA-02 satisfied nowhere.

### Domain: BA-02 operator-pass evidence — RED file I/O vs. GREEN correlator vs. BLUE-minted hash (N-F-C; I/O wired N-F-G-C)

| Layer | Module | Color | Role |
|-------|--------|-------|------|
| **Data-only evidence file I/O** | `ade_node::ba02_pass` (`correlate_peer_log_file`, `write_ba02_manifest`; NEW, S2 — `//! RED`) | RED | Operator-pass BA-02 evidence file I/O. `correlate_peer_log_file` reads the operator-captured peer-accept JSONL → GREEN `parse_peer_accept_events` + `correlate`; a missing/unreadable file ⇒ `io::Error` (fail-closed), never a synthesized acceptance. `write_ba02_manifest` accepts **ONLY a `Ba02Manifest`** (which only `correlate`'s exact-match arm constructs). Constructs no evidence, derives no acceptance, never coerces a non-acceptance line. **NO new closed enum / registry.** |
| **Evidence correlator (compares already-authoritative outputs) — UNCHANGED** | `ade_node::ba02_evidence` (`parse_peer_accept_events`, `correlate`, closed `BA02Outcome` / `PeerAcceptEvent` / `PeerAcceptSource` / `NoEvidenceReason` / versioned `Ba02Manifest`) | GREEN | COMPARES the BLUE-minted forged hash (read verbatim, never recomputed) against an operator-captured peer-accept signal; `correlate` is the **SOLE** `Ba02Manifest` constructor (hash-primary; exact-match arm only). Forges/admits/persists nothing. UNCHANGED by G-C — only *consumed* by the new RED `ba02_pass` wrapper. RO-LIVE-06. |
| **Authoritative forge record source** | `ade_node::ba02_evidence::AdeForgeRecord::from_forge_artifact` | GREEN | Reads the BLUE-minted forged hash + slot VERBATIM from `ForgedBlockArtifact` — NEVER recomputed; no new BLUE authority. |

**Rule (RO-LIVE-06 / CN-OPERATOR-EVIDENCE-01; `ci_check_ba02_evidence_closed.sh` +
`ci_check_ba02_evidence_manifest_schema.sh`):** the RED `ba02_pass` is **file I/O ONLY** over the UNCHANGED GREEN
correlator; **all evidence semantics live in GREEN `correlate`** — the SOLE `Ba02Manifest` constructor (no
self-evidence acceptance source: not `ForgeSucceeded` / `self_accept` / `block_received` / served-block /
wire-success / `agreement_verdict` / "agreed"). `write_ba02_manifest` accepts ONLY a `Ba02Manifest`, so a written
manifest is **always correlate-produced** from a real peer log; **no synthetic manifest is committed** (the new
gate is vacuous-until-committed; when a `CE-G-C-LIVE_*.toml` is committed it verifies the 8-field schema +
`schema_version == 1` + `peer_log_file_sha256 == sha256(fixture)`). **The `correlate` chokepoint never moves.**
**Honest scope:** `ba02_pass` is reached by NO binary arm at this HEAD (tested only — incl. the env-gated
`node_operator_pass_ba02_live`). BA-02 is satisfied NOWHERE at this HEAD; a real result needs an operator-captured
peer log through `correlate` against a peer that can grant leadership (C1/C2). RO-LIVE-01 stays partial/operator-gated.

### Domain: forge-constant fidelity — current-pparams source + checked clock + off-epoch guard (GREEN parse / GREEN accessor / BLUE authority-behind-seams; N-F-G-A)

| Layer | Module | Color | Role |
|-------|--------|-------|------|
| **Data-only current-pparams parser** | `ade_runtime::consensus_inputs::protocol_params` (`parse_protocol_parameters_json`, closed `ProtocolParamsParseError`) | GREEN | The cardano-cli `query protocol-parameters` JSON parser. Converts the oracle's pparams JSON preimage into a canonical BLUE `ade_ledger::pparams::ProtocolParameters`. **No float path** — rational literals preserved as `RawValue` strings → exact `ade_ledger::rational::Rational` by INTEGER arithmetic; a non-exact literal fails closed (`InexactRational`). Produces the parameter record but is NOT its author; decides nothing semantic. Promotable to BLUE. |
| **Hash-bound current-pparams accessor** | `ade_runtime::consensus_inputs::canonical::require_forge_current_pparams` (closed 3-variant `ForgeCurrentPParamsError`) | GREEN | `LiveConsensusInputsCanonical` carries `protocol_params_json: Option<String>` **OUTSIDE** the frozen 15-field fingerprint (the fingerprint commits to `protocol_params_hash`). The accessor requires the preimage present (`PreimageAbsent`), `blake2b_256`-binds it to the fingerprinted `protocol_params_hash` (`BindMismatch`), and parses exactly (`Parse`). A hash-bound gate, not the authority. |
| **Checked clock→slot guard** | `ade_runtime::clock::checked_millis_to_slot` (closed 1-variant `SlotAlignmentError`) | GREEN | A before-anchor tick (`tick_millis < start_millis`) fails closed `BeforeGenesisAnchor` instead of saturating to `start_slot`; otherwise the EXACT `millis_to_slot` result. Pure integer arithmetic; no float, no wall-clock. The saturating `millis_to_slot` is left intact for non-forge callers. A fail-closed boundary, not an authority. |
| **Off-epoch admission guard** | `ade_node::node_sync::forge_epoch_admission` (closed 2-variant `ForgeEpochAdmission`) | GREEN-by-fn (inside RED `node_sync`) | Derived SOLELY from `(slot, era_schedule, seed_epoch)` via the BLUE `EraSchedule::locate`. Within the seed epoch ⇒ `WithinSeedEpoch`; any other / unlocatable ⇒ `OffEpoch`. Called BEFORE `query_leader_schedule` inside `forge_one_from_recovered`. A pure fail-closed guard, not the epoch authority. |
| **Authoritative epoch locator** | `ade_core::consensus::era_schedule::EraSchedule::locate` | BLUE | The single BLUE epoch locator the off-epoch guard derives the candidate epoch from. No fabricated epoch math. UNCHANGED by G-A. |
| **Authoritative ProtocolParameters / Rational** | `ade_ledger::pparams::ProtocolParameters` + `ade_ledger::rational::Rational` | BLUE | The canonical parameter model + exact-integer rational arithmetic the GREEN parser produces into. Pre-existing BLUE types; UNCHANGED by G-A (no float in `rational`). |
| **Current-pparams install (recovered ledger)** | `ade_node::admission::{seed_to_snapshot, bootstrap}` (`build_seed_ledger`) | RED | Installs the supplied CURRENT `ProtocolParameters` (never `::default()`) into the recovered ledger at seed/import; warm-start preserves it. The forge-capable caller passes the oracle-bound parameters via `require_forge_current_pparams`. |
| **Off-epoch outcome (deliberately NOT extended)** | `ade_runtime::producer::coordinator::CoordinatorEvent` (9-variant) | GREEN | An off-epoch forge routes through the EXISTING `CoordinatorEvent::ForgeNotLeader` — **NO new variant added**. The closed 9-variant event set stays additively stable. |

**Rule (DC-EPOCH-03 / CE-G-A-1/2/2a/4):** forge fidelity is **real config + current pparams + two fail-closed
boundaries inside the existing forge fence**. The GREEN parser/accessor/guards are **data-only / fail-closed
boundaries** — all semantic authority (the `ProtocolParameters` model, exact `Rational` arithmetic, the
`EraSchedule::locate` epoch locator) stays BLUE. The recovered ledger pparams are sourced from the oracle
preimage (never defaulted); the config ingress uses the REAL parsers (no `parse_simple_*` on the node path);
the off-epoch guard runs BEFORE leadership via `EraSchedule::locate` (no fabricated epoch, no nonce
promotion); `protocol_params` has **no float path** (exact `Rational` or fail closed); `checked_millis_to_slot`
**fails closed before-anchor** (never saturates); the `protocol_params_json` preimage stays **OUTSIDE** the
15-field canonical fingerprint. **None of these chokepoints move**; `run_relay_loop`'s containment is
**semantically unchanged**. This is **forge-fidelity HARDENING** — it does NOT serve / admit / gossip /
advance a durable tip; the forge stays **subordinate + self-accept-only**; the empty binary source halts
before any `ForgeTick` (forge-CAPABLE, NOT observable — RO-LIVE-01). The S1 genesis-consistency fixture is
**evidence input, never runtime authority**. **BA-02 satisfied nowhere.**

### Domain: operator-key ingress + forge-on flip (GREEN classifier / RED ingress / single-authority reuse; N-F-F, real parsers N-F-G-A)

| Layer | Module | Color | Role |
|-------|--------|-------|------|
| **Pure forge-intent classifier** | `ade_node::forge_intent` (`classify_forge_intent`, closed `ForgeIntent { On(ForgePaths), Off }`, `ForgePaths`, `ForgeIntentError::PartialKeySet`) | GREEN | The total, content-blind decision "may `--mode node` forge?" — a pure function of which operator-key CLI flags are *present* (never their contents). All five present ⇒ `On`; none ⇒ `Off`; any partial ⇒ `PartialKeySet` (static flag-name strings only). No I/O, no secret; promotable to BLUE. Decides nothing semantic; a partial set is an *error*, never an *intent*. CN-NODE-03 (intent half). |
| **Operator-material ingress site (data-only loader reuse)** | `ade_node::operator_forge` (`load_operator_producer_shell`, `build_operator_forge_material`, closed 6-variant `OperatorForgeError`, `OperatorForgeMaterial`) | RED | The SINGLE named `--mode node` operator-material ingress site. REUSES the existing cold/vrf/kes loaders + (N-F-G-A) the REAL `parse_opcert_envelope` / `parse_shelley_genesis` (no reimpl) → BLUE structural validators (`Sum6Kes::raw_deserialize_signing_key_kes`; `ProducerShell::init` enforces the opcert shape + KES-period-vs-opcert freshness bound, CN-PROD-02) → canonical types. `pool_id = Hash28(blake2b_224(cold_vk))` (the one named derivation); genesis reused for clock/KES/network anchors only. `OperatorForgeMaterial` is NOT `Debug`/`Serialize`. NO new BLUE authority, NO plugin seam, NO second forge codepath. CN-NODE-03 (custody half). |
| **Authoritative KES structural validator** | `ade_crypto::kes_sum::Sum6Kes::raw_deserialize_signing_key_kes` | BLUE | Byte layout IS the validator for the 608-byte cardano-cli skey envelope. UNCHANGED. |
| **Authoritative shell-init freshness bound** | `ade_ledger`/`ade_runtime` `ProducerShell::init` (reused) | BLUE+RED | Enforces the opcert shape + the KES-period-vs-opcert freshness bound (CN-PROD-02). UNCHANGED — reused, not reimplemented. |
| **Single bootstrap / forge-base authority (reused)** | `ade_runtime::bootstrap::bootstrap_initial_state` (via the lifecycle owner) | GREEN-by-content (+RED restore) | The `On` arm's forge base is the SAME single recovered `BootstrapState` that seeds the relay spine — no second bootstrap, no Mithril call, no second recovered state (CN-NODE-01). N-F-G-A: the recovered ledger now carries the oracle-bound current `ProtocolParameters`. |

**Rule (CN-NODE-03 / CN-NODE-01):** operator-key ingress is **STRICTLY RED-parse → BLUE-structural-validate
→ canonical-type**, reusing the existing loaders + (N-F-G-A) the real opcert/genesis parsers. The GREEN
classifier decides forge *intent* over flag *presence* and nothing semantic; the RED ingress site holds key
custody confined to `ProducerShell` (`OperatorForgeMaterial` not `Debug`/`Serialize`; no byte accessor /
serialization / logging; no copy into the GREEN coordinator / planner / loop / persisted / logged /
hashed-for-evidence / replay surfaces). **No new BLUE authority, no parser reimpl, no plugin/trait seam, no
second forge codepath, no new BLUE crate change.** A partial key set fails closed
(`NodeLifecycleError::ForgeKeyIngress` → exit 44). `pool_id` is derived in ONE named place, never fabricated.
The forge base is the single recovered `BootstrapState` (no second bootstrap). **The forge containment from
N-F-E stays SEMANTICALLY UNCHANGED** — N-F-F/N-F-G-A/N-F-G-C may ADD ingress/fidelity/live-feed gates but MUST
NOT relax it. **None of these chokepoints move.** **Honest scope:** the binary is forge-CAPABLE with real keys +
real constants; N-F-G-C makes the On arm live-feed-wireable (observable forge at a due leader slot) but peer
ACCEPT stays operator-gated (RO-LIVE-01). No serve-to-peer / admit / gossip / durable-tip / BA-02 / RO-LIVE
claim. Mithril untouched.

### Domain: live relay run-loop (GREEN planner / RED driver / BLUE authority-behind-seams; N-F-D, forge-tick N-F-E, forge-on flip N-F-F, fidelity N-F-G-A, live feed N-F-G-C)

| Layer | Module | Color | Role |
|-------|--------|-------|------|
| **Pure lifecycle planner** | `ade_node::run_loop_planner` (`plan_loop_step`, closed `LoopStep`, content-blind `SyncStatus` + `ForgeSlotStatus`, the pure `forge_slot_status` guard) | GREEN | Decides each iteration's `LoopStep` from content-blind inputs over a total table. Emits ONLY `{SyncOnce, ForgeTick, Idle, HaltCleanly}` — **cannot express an authority decision**. `forge_slot_status` is the ONLY fn here that observes a `SlotNo`. With `ForgeSlotStatus::NotDue` the table collapses to the N-F-D relay mapping. Decides nothing semantic. UNCHANGED by N-F-G-A / N-F-G-C. CN-NODE-02 / DC-NODE-05. |
| **Live-run driver (the single owner)** | `ade_node::node_lifecycle::run_relay_loop` | RED | Both `--mode node` arms converge here. Performs effects per the GREEN plan: `SyncOnce → run_node_sync` (the SOLE durable tip-advance; N-F-G-C feeds it from the LIVE WirePump source), `ForgeTick →` exactly one fenced `forge_one_from_recovered` (advances no tip, serves/admits/gossips nothing in the body), `Idle →` cancellation-safe wait, `HaltCleanly →` exit. **Body containment SEMANTICALLY UNCHANGED across N-F-E → N-F-F → N-F-G-A → N-F-G-B → N-F-G-C** — the source-selection happens in the dispatcher BEFORE the loop; the run loop body is byte-unchanged. CN-NODE-02 / DC-SYNC-02 / DC-NODE-05. |
| **Opt-in forge-activation bundle** | `ade_node::node_lifecycle::ForgeActivation<'a>` (N-F-E; REAL operator material N-F-F; current pparams + checked-clock fail field N-F-G-A; opt-in `handoff_tx` N-F-G-B) | RED | The closed opt-in bundle (`forge: Option<&mut ForgeActivation>`): borrows the `Clock` seam (checked at N-F-G-A), the `CoordinatorState`, the recovered `BootstrapState` (SOLE leadership source + forge base), the `ProducerShell` (key custody), `pool_id` / current `pparams` / `protocol_version` / `last_slot_alignment_fail` / the opt-in `handoff_tx: Option<mpsc::UnboundedSender<SelfAcceptedHandoff>>` (N-F-G-B). `None` ⇒ exact N-F-D/N-F-E relay. Decides nothing semantic. |
| **Live-feed source builder (REUSE)** | `ade_node::node_lifecycle::spawn_live_wire_pump_source` (N-F-G-C) | RED | Builds the LIVE `NodeBlockSource::WirePump` from `--peer` by reusing the closed `dial_for_admission` + `run_admission_wire_pump` (a FILL, not a new variant); handed to `run_relay_loop`. Decides nothing; moves bytes from a reused dial into a closed source. |
| **Authoritative durable apply** | `ade_runtime::forward_sync::pump_block` (carried fwd, N-Y) | RED + BLUE admit | The durability-ordered driver `run_node_sync` feeds; the BLUE admit chokepoint + `StoreBlockBytes`/`AppendWal`-before-`AdvanceTip` invariant live here. UNMODIFIED. |
| **Authoritative forge handoff** | `ade_node::node_sync::forge_one_from_recovered` (carried fwd, N-F-C; N-F-G-A S4 off-epoch guard; N-F-G-B token surfacing) | RED (driver) → BLUE | Projects leadership ONLY via `PoolDistrView::from_seed_epoch_consensus_inputs`; eligibility is the BLUE leader-schedule. **N-F-G-A** calls `forge_epoch_admission` BEFORE `query_leader_schedule`. **N-F-G-B** returns `(CoordinatorEvent, Option<SelfAcceptedHandoff>)`. CN-CINPUT-03 / DC-CINPUT-02b / DC-EPOCH-03 / DC-NODE-06. |

**Rule (CN-NODE-02 / DC-SYNC-02 / DC-NODE-05 / DC-EPOCH-03 / DC-NODE-06):** the GREEN planner decides iteration
shape over a closed, content-blind vocabulary and cannot decide authority; the RED driver performs effects but
advances the tip ONLY via `run_node_sync → pump_block` and (if forging) reaches EXACTLY ONE fenced
`forge_one_from_recovered`, serving/admitting/gossiping nothing in the body; BLUE authority stays behind the
existing seams. The wall-clock enters ONLY through the RED `Clock` seam (now checked — before-anchor fails
closed), and only a `SlotNo` crosses into GREEN/BLUE. The off-epoch guard fails the forge closed before
leadership (N-F-G-A). The N-F-G-B handoff is a typed `tx.send` only (served-chain mutation in the SIBLING task).
**N-F-G-C leaves `run_relay_loop`'s body containment byte-unchanged** — the live-feed source-selection happens in
the dispatcher before the loop; the source handed in is the closed `NodeBlockSource` (a `from_wire_pump` FILL).
The forge is **subordinate** to the sync spine — a forged block is a local self-accept artifact, served only via
the fenced sibling `push_atomic`, never a tip advance. **None of these chokepoints move.** **Honest scope:** the
binary is forge-CAPABLE with real keys + real constants; with a LIVE `--peer` feed (N-F-G-C) the forge becomes
observable at a due leader slot, but peer ACCEPT is operator-gated (RO-LIVE-01 partial); BA-02 satisfied nowhere.

### Domain: recovered seed-epoch consensus inputs (N-F-A; CONSUMED in N-F-C, exercised by the N-F-E forge tick + the N-F-F On arm + the N-F-G-A current-constants tick)

| Layer | Module | Color | Role |
|-------|--------|-------|------|
| **Authoritative canonical record + SOLE codec** | `ade_ledger::seed_consensus_inputs` (`SeedEpochConsensusInputs`, `encode_/decode_seed_epoch_consensus_inputs`, `SEED_CINPUT_SCHEMA_VERSION = 1`) | BLUE | The closed recovered-state record + its SOLE version-gated, byte-canonical encoder/decoder pair. `decode_*` fail-closes on unknown version, wrong shape, short hash, non-canonical / duplicate pool-map keys, trailing bytes (closed 6-variant `SeedConsensusInputsError`). No second codec. (CN-CINPUT-01.) |
| **Data-only merge glue** | `ade_runtime::seed_consensus_merge::merge_seed_epoch_consensus_inputs` | GREEN | Lifts a verified-bootstrap two-map `LiveConsensusInputsCanonical` into the BLUE single-map record; fail-closed (closed 2-variant `SeedConsensusMergeError`) — never a zero-hash fill. Produces the BLUE record but is NOT its author; decides nothing semantic. |
| **Data-only WAL provenance appender** | `ade_runtime::seed_consensus_provenance::append_seed_epoch_provenance` | RED | `blake2b_256` of the EXACT A1 sidecar bytes → `WalEntry::SeedEpochConsensusInputsImported` (tag 3) append. Allowed only at the two verified-bootstrap composition sites; called only AFTER the durable sidecar put. |
| **Data-only sidecar store** | `ade_runtime::chaindb::SnapshotStore::{put,get,list}_seed_epoch_consensus_*` | RED | Anchor-fp-keyed sidecar namespace **disjoint** from the slot-keyed snapshot space; idempotent on identical bytes; redb `seed_cinputs_by_anchor_fp` table, `SCHEMA_VERSION = 3`. N-F-C added the read-only `list_seed_epoch_consensus_anchor_fps` discovery method. No semantic decision. |
| **Authoritative warm-start restore** | `ade_runtime::bootstrap::restore_seed_epoch_consensus_inputs` (inside `bootstrap_initial_state`) | RED read + BLUE verify | The `get_seed_epoch_consensus_inputs` read is the only RED step; bind → decode → anchor/epoch binding → byte-identity verification is BLUE, fail-closed via the 5 `BootstrapError::SeedConsensus*` variants. **MUST NOT** fall back to the forge-time bundle. (DC-CINPUT-01.) Wired on the `--mode node` WarmStart arm. |
| **Authoritative replay fold** | `ade_ledger::wal::replay_from_anchor` (`ReplayOutcome`, `RecoveredBootstrapProvenance`) | BLUE | Folds the additive tag-3 entry into `ReplayOutcome.recovered_provenance` (at most one; `DuplicateProvenance` / `ProvenanceAnchorMismatch` fail closed) **without** disturbing the `AdmitBlock` fp-chain. Pure. |
| **Authoritative projection (consumed since N-F-C; exercised by the N-F-E forge tick + N-F-F On arm + N-F-G-A tick)** | `ade_ledger::consensus_view::PoolDistrView::from_seed_epoch_consensus_inputs` | BLUE | Pure field-map projecting the recovered record into the leadership `PoolDistrView` (off-epoch ⇒ `None`; no zero-hash fallback). The SOLE leadership source the node-lifecycle forge handoff consumes (DC-CINPUT-02a + DC-CINPUT-02b / CN-CINPUT-03). |
| **Consume-side forge handoff** | `ade_node::node_sync::forge_one_from_recovered` | RED (driver) | Builds the forge base ENTIRELY from recovered state + the selected tip: projects leadership ONLY via `PoolDistrView::from_seed_epoch_consensus_inputs`, fails closed (`NodeForgeError::MissingRecoveredConsensusInputs`) when none, and MUST NOT fabricate a `SeedEpochConsensusInputs` literal or name a forge-time bundle token. The CONSUME-side fence — CN-CINPUT-03 / DC-CINPUT-02b, guard (d). **N-F-G-A** adds the off-epoch `forge_epoch_admission` guard BEFORE leadership (DC-EPOCH-03). _Production code otherwise UNMODIFIED._ |
| **Read-only anchor discovery** | `ade_runtime::chaindb::SnapshotStore::list_seed_epoch_consensus_anchor_fps` | RED | Returns persisted anchor lineages in ascending order. Discovery is NOT proof; the warm-start verify chain is the authority. Sole caller `node_lifecycle::warm_start_recovery`. |

**Rule (CN-CINPUT-01 / -02 / -03 / DC-CINPUT-01 / -02a / -02b):** the recovered seed-epoch consensus inputs
are a **closed canonical type with a SOLE codec**. The RED/GREEN shells merge, encode, put, and append
provenance; **all semantic decisions (decode, binding verification, the leadership projection) live in BLUE**.
Population is **contained** to the verified-bootstrap composition path; the forge-time path MUST NOT build /
put the sidecar nor append its WAL provenance (CN-CINPUT-02). The warm-start restore + replay fold live inside
the **single `bootstrap_initial_state` authority** and the BLUE `wal::replay_from_anchor` — **neither
chokepoint moves.** The consume side is wired (the `--mode node` WarmStart arm +
`node_sync::forge_one_from_recovered`) behind the consume-side fence (guard (d)). **N-F-G-A note:** the forge
tick now also runs the off-epoch `forge_epoch_admission` guard (via `EraSchedule::locate`) before leadership;
the projection stays the SOLE leadership source. `produce_mode` stays diagnostic and still passes
`SeedEpochConsensusSource::NotRequired`.

### Domain: node lifecycle + BA-02 evidence (N-F-C; BA-02 file I/O wired N-F-G-C)

| Layer | Module | Color | Role |
|-------|--------|-------|------|
| **Lifecycle owner (single authority router)** | `ade_node::node_lifecycle` (`run_node_lifecycle`, `classify_start`, `first_run_mithril_bootstrap`, `warm_start_recovery`, `run_relay_loop`) | RED | THE single `--mode node` recovered-state lifecycle owner (`PHASE4-N-F-C-LIFECYCLE-OWNER`). Classifies FirstRun vs WarmStart as a PURE function of on-disk state; both arms route initial state through the SINGLE `bootstrap_initial_state` authority and converge into `run_relay_loop` (N-F-D). N-F-F adds the forge-intent classify + `Some`/`None` flip; N-F-G-A sources the On-arm constants from the recovered current view; N-F-G-C selects the live `WirePump` source (`--peer`) vs the empty source. Decides nothing semantic; never a second bootstrap/recovery/storage-init path (CN-NODE-01). |
| **Verdict-decoupled block source** | `ade_node::node_sync::NodeBlockSource` + `run_node_sync` | RED | Yields ordered peer-block BYTES only (skips `TipUpdate`, ends on `Disconnected`; N-F-D added a content-blind readiness signal; N-F-G-C added `from_wire_pump` — a FILL of the WirePump arm); `run_node_sync` is the production caller of `forward_sync::pump_block` (durable-before-tip, DC-SYNC-01). NEVER carries/derives a verdict. Driven on the live path by the N-F-D relay loop. |
| **Authoritative durable apply** | `ade_runtime::forward_sync::pump_block` (carried fwd, N-Y) | RED + BLUE admit | The durability-ordered driver the source feeds; the BLUE admit chokepoint + `StoreBlockBytes`/`AppendWal`-before-`AdvanceTip` invariant live here, not in the source. |
| **Evidence correlator (compares already-authoritative outputs)** | `ade_node::ba02_evidence` (`parse_peer_accept_events`, `correlate`) | GREEN | COMPARES the BLUE-minted forged hash (read verbatim, never recomputed) against an operator-captured peer-accept signal; `correlate` is the SOLE `Ba02Manifest` constructor. Forges/admits/persists nothing. RO-LIVE-06. _N-F-G-C: now CONSUMED by the RED `ba02_pass` file-I/O wrapper (still reached by no binary arm; tested only)._ |
| **Evidence file I/O (N-F-G-C)** | `ade_node::ba02_pass` (`correlate_peer_log_file`, `write_ba02_manifest`) | RED | Reads the operator-captured peer-log file into the GREEN `correlate`; `write_ba02_manifest` accepts ONLY a `Ba02Manifest`. A missing/unreadable file fails closed (`io::Error`). Constructs no evidence; reached by no binary arm at this HEAD. RO-LIVE-06 / CN-OPERATOR-EVIDENCE-01. |

**Rule (CN-NODE-01 / DC-SYNC-01 / RO-LIVE-06 / CN-OPERATOR-EVIDENCE-01):** the lifecycle owner ROUTES (single
`bootstrap_initial_state` authority on both arms); the block source is data-only (bytes, never a verdict; the
N-F-G-C live `WirePump` fill stays a closed verdict-decoupled contract); the durable apply + admit authority stay
in `pump_block`; the BA-02 correlator is GREEN evidence whose SOLE constructor admits no self-evidence acceptance
source and emits no committed synthetic manifest, and the N-F-G-C RED `ba02_pass` is file I/O ONLY over it
(`write_ba02_manifest` accepts ONLY a `Ba02Manifest`). **None of these chokepoints move.** **Honest scope:**
`ba02_evidence` + `ba02_pass` are reached by no binary arm (tested only); `node_sync` is driven on the live path
only by the N-F-D relay loop (SyncOnce — now from a LIVE feed with `--peer`) + the forge tick (ForgeTick, with a
`ForgeActivation`). **BA-02 is satisfied NOWHERE at this HEAD; RO-LIVE-01 remains partial/operator-gated.**

### Domain: bootstrap seed provenance (N-Y, extended N-Z + N-F-A; UNTOUCHED by N-F-F / N-F-G-A / N-F-G-C)

| Layer | Module | Color | Role |
|-------|--------|-------|------|
| **Data-only Mithril shell** | `ade_runtime::mithril_import::{json, importer}` | RED | `parse_mithril_manifest_json` is the SOLE manifest-JSON parser; `import_mithril_manifest` maps it into the closed `SeedProvenance::Mithril` + `MithrilManifestReport`. No semantic decision; never re-verifies the STM multisig. |
| **Mithril production-bootstrap composition** *(N-Z; +N-F-A sidecar tail; N-F-C first non-test caller)* | `ade_runtime::mithril_bootstrap::bootstrap_from_mithril_snapshot` | RED | **Composition-only**: import → mint anchor from the operator-independent `MithrilSeedPointInputs` → BLUE `verify_mithril_binding` fail-closed BEFORE storage init → single `bootstrap_initial_state` (NotRequired) → N-F-A sidecar tail. Symmetric with `bootstrap_from_conway_genesis`. No new authority, no new `SeedProvenance` variant, no CLI surface. Closed `MithrilBootstrapError`. **N-F-F/N-F-G-A/N-F-G-C do NOT call this** — operator-key ingress / forge fidelity / live feed is not a bootstrap. |
| **Data-only genesis shell** | `ade_runtime::genesis_bootstrap::bootstrap_from_conway_genesis` + `producer::genesis_parser` | RED | Reads + parses the Conway genesis file; routes the transform through the single bootstrap authority; runs the same sidecar tail. NOT on the N-F-C node lifecycle (FirstRun is Mithril-only). The N-F-F/N-F-G-A ingress reuses `genesis_parser` (N-F-G-A: the REAL `parse_shelley_genesis`) for clock/KES/network anchor extraction ONLY. |
| **Authoritative binding predicate** | `ade_ledger::bootstrap_anchor::binding::verify_mithril_binding` | BLUE | The sole authority deciding whether a Mithril anchor binds — a pure predicate cross-checking `{network_magic, genesis_hash, certified_point, certificate_hash}`; fails closed with `MithrilImportError`. |
| **Authoritative genesis transform** | `ade_ledger::genesis_source::genesis_initial_state` | BLUE | The pure Conway-only transform; fail-closed `GenesisSourceError::NonConwayEra`. |
| **Single bootstrap chokepoint** | `ade_runtime::bootstrap::bootstrap_initial_state` | GREEN-by-content (+ RED A3b restore) | The ONE authority all initial state flows through — `genesis_bootstrap`, the N-Y Mithril provenance path, the N-Z composition, the N-F-A warm-start restore, AND both N-F-C lifecycle arms all route here. Returns the named `BootstrapState`; the `SeedEpochConsensusSource` discriminant selects cold-start vs. warm-start restore. The N-F-F On arm reuses the resulting recovered `BootstrapState` as the forge base — NEVER a second bootstrap. |

**Rule (CN-MITHRIL-01 / CN-NODE-01 / DC-GENESIS-SRC-01 / DC-MITHRIL-02):** the RED shells parse bytes and
produce reports/configs / mint anchors; **all** semantic decisions live in BLUE. All initial state routes
through the **single** `bootstrap_initial_state` authority. **There is NO `GenesisAnchor` / `MithrilAnchor`
trait or plugin seam.** `verify_mithril_binding` MUST NOT be tautological. New seed-source support adds a RED
parse/map shell + (if a new authoritative decision is needed) a BLUE predicate/transform + (for production
wiring) a composition-only RED twin of `bootstrap_from_{conway_genesis, mithril_snapshot}`; **the
`bootstrap_initial_state` chokepoint never moves.** **N-F-F/N-F-G-A/N-F-G-C note:** Mithril stays the
bootstrap/recovery layer untouched — a bootstrap accelerator, not a validation/forge shortcut; operator-key
ingress / forge fidelity / the live feed neither calls Mithril nor creates a second bootstrap.

### Domain: network forward-sync (durable-before-tip, N-Y; first production driver N-F-C; driven by the N-F-D loop; LIVE feed N-F-G-C)

| Layer | Module | Color | Role |
|-------|--------|-------|------|
| **Effect-plan reducer** | `ade_runtime::forward_sync::reducer` (`forward_sync_step`, `AdmitPlan::durable`) | GREEN-by-content | Composes the BLUE admit chokepoint and emits the closed `SyncEffect` plan. The private `AdmitPlan::durable` is the **sole** `AdvanceTip` emitter and fixes the durable-before-tip order — an out-of-order plan is structurally inexpressible. |
| **Durability-ordered driver** | `ade_runtime::forward_sync::pump` (`pump_block`) | RED | Applies the reducer's `SyncEffect` plan in order against the persistent `ChainDb` + `FileWalStore` + snapshot writer; refuses to advance the tip before `StoreBlockBytes` + `AppendWal` return Ok — `PumpError::TipBeforeDurable`. Its production caller is `node_sync::run_node_sync`, driven each iteration by the N-F-D relay loop's `SyncOnce`. N-F-G-C: the bytes it folds now come from a LIVE `NodeBlockSource::WirePump` (reusing the closed admission dial + pump) when `--peer` is supplied. |

**Rule (DC-SYNC-01 / DC-SYNC-02):** the GREEN reducer decides the effect plan; the RED pump applies it in
durable order. This GREEN-reducer / RED-pump split mirrors the `ade_network::session` (GREEN) /
`ade_runtime::network::mux_pump` (RED) split. `AdvanceTip` is unreachable before `StoreBlockBytes` +
`AppendWal` (`ci_check_forward_sync_chokepoint_only.sh`). N-F-C's `run_node_sync` advances the tip ONLY via
`pump_block` (`ci_check_node_sync_via_pump.sh`); N-F-D's relay loop drives `run_node_sync` each iteration;
N-F-G-C feeds it a LIVE peer (the feed-side RO-LIVE-01 follow-on, now wired) without changing the
single-`AdvanceTip`-emitter chokepoint. New sync logic adds `SyncEffect` variants + reducer arms; **the
single-`AdvanceTip`-emitter chokepoint never moves.** An **acceptance-criterion** seam, not a registry-law surface.

### Domain: crash recovery (N-Y, extended N-F-A provenance fold; production restart wired N-F-C; loop-as-replay N-F-D/N-F-E/N-F-G-A)

| Layer | Module | Color | Role |
|-------|--------|-------|------|
| **Recovery wiring (test-only entry)** | `ade_runtime::recovery::restart::recover_node_state` | RED | Composes the EXISTING authorities (`WalStore::read_all` + BLUE `wal::replay_from_anchor` + `rollback_to_slot`) to reconcile the ChainDb to the WAL tail. No second recovery engine. Fail-fast on `WalTailFingerprintMismatch`. Still the test-only secondary entry — the PRODUCTION restart path is the N-F-C WarmStart arm. |
| **Production restart path** | `ade_node::node_lifecycle::warm_start_recovery` | RED | The WarmStart arm: anchor-lineage discovery → WAL replay → restore through the single `bootstrap_initial_state(RequiredFromRecoveredProvenance)` authority. No second recovery engine; fail-closed. Converges into `run_relay_loop`. |

**Rule (recovery-contract / DC-WAL-*; restart wired N-F-C; loop-as-replay N-F-D/N-F-E):** recovery composes
existing authorities; it never re-implements replay or rollback (`ci_check_recovery_contract.sh`). The N-F-A
`ReplayOutcome` additively carries the recovered seed-epoch provenance without disturbing the `AdmitBlock`
fp-chain. **N-F-D/N-F-E extend replay-equivalence to continuous operation (T-REC-03):** the same
recovered/bootstrapped state + the same ordered canonical block feed + the same deterministic loop inputs +
(N-F-E) the same injected clock-tick + shutdown schedule produce byte-identical authoritative outputs.
**N-F-G-A note:** the S1 genesis-consistency pinning harness drives the REAL `bootstrap_initial_state`
warm-start against the committed Ade-as-leader reference fixture and pins the recovered values — the fixture
is **evidence input, never runtime authority**. `warm_start_recovery` is the single production restart owner
(CN-NODE-01).

### Domain: N2N tag-24 wire envelope (N-X)

| Layer | Module | Color | Role |
|-------|--------|-------|------|
| **Sole byte wrap/unwrap authority** | `ade_codec::cbor::tag24::{wrap_tag24, unwrap_tag24}` | BLUE | The single workspace authority that wraps inner bytes in a tag-24 (`0xd8 0x18`) envelope and strips it. `unwrap_tag24` returns a zero-copy borrow (no re-encode); fails closed with `TagEnvelopeError`. Each defined exactly once. |
| **BlockFetch composition** | `ade_network::codec::block_fetch::{compose,decompose}_blockfetch_block` | BLUE | A served `MsgBlock` payload = `tag24(bytes([era, block]))` — era **inside** the wrap; **Conway = storage index 7**. |
| **ChainSync composition** | `ade_network::codec::chain_sync::{compose,decompose}_rollforward_header, chain_sync_wire_era_index}` | BLUE | A served `RollForward` header = `[era_tag, tag24(bytes(header_cbor))]` — era_tag **outside** the wrap; **CONSENSUS era index, Conway = 6 = storage − 1**. |
| **Serve emitters** | `ade_network::block_fetch::server` / `chain_sync::server` | BLUE | Emit composed (tag-24-wrapped) bytes — never a bare `[era, block]` / bare header. |
| **RED consumers (migrated)** | `ade_node::admission::runner` + `ade_core_interop::follow` | RED | Strip a peer's tag-24 envelope via `ade_codec::unwrap_tag24`; no local parse. _(N-F-G-C: the live `--mode node` feed reuses `admission::runner`'s closed pump path verbatim.)_ |

**Rule (CN-WIRE-08):** one tag-24 byte authority + per-protocol composition layered over it. The two N2N
surfaces use **different era-index schemes** (BlockFetch storage Conway = 7; ChainSync consensus Conway = 6 =
storage − 1), pinned byte-identically against cardano-node 11.0.1 captures. No hand-rolled tag-24 parse in
RED. **The wrap/unwrap chokepoint never moves.**

### Domain: block codec (decode + encode)

| Layer | Module | Color | Role |
|-------|--------|-------|------|
| **Authoritative ingress** | `ade_codec::cbor::envelope::decode_block_envelope` + per-era `decode_*_block` | BLUE | Sole `PreservedCbor` construction site; operates over the verbatim tag-24-stripped inner bytes on the wire path (N-X). |
| **Authoritative egress (N-V)** | `ade_codec::cbor::envelope::encode_block_envelope` | BLUE | The single block-envelope encoder; emits storage-form `[era, block]` (Conway = discriminant 7, head `82 07`). |
| **Producer consumer** | `ade_ledger::producer::forge::forge_block` | BLUE | Wraps forged output via `encode_block_envelope`. |

**Rule (CN-FORGE-03, strengthened N-X):** one block-envelope grammar in both directions; forge and validate
share it. The on-wire serve form is the N-X tag-24 composition over this storage-form. **The encode/decode
chokepoint pair never moves.**

### Domain: leader-eligibility VRF input (N-W)

| Layer | Module | Color | Role |
|-------|--------|-------|------|
| **Sole era→construction authority** | `ade_core::consensus::vrf_cert::leader_vrf_input(era, slot, eta0)` | BLUE | The single place selecting a Praos vs TPraos leader-eligibility VRF construction; returns the closed `ExpectedVrfInput`. |
| **Era-correct range-extension** | `ade_core::consensus::vrf_cert::leader_value_for` | BLUE | Praos `praos_leader_value` vs TPraos identity, dispatched on the `ExpectedVrfInput` variant. |
| **Leader-schedule producer** | `ade_core::consensus::leader_schedule::query_leader_schedule` | BLUE | Builds `LeaderScheduleAnswer.expected_vrf_input` via `leader_vrf_input`. Called by `forge_one_from_recovered` AFTER the N-F-G-A off-epoch guard. |
| **RED prove-step consumer** | `ade_node::produce_mode::run_real_forge` | RED | Proves over `answer.expected_vrf_input.alpha_bytes()`; non-Praos era fail-closes. Reused by `node_sync::forge_one_from_recovered` (the N-F-E/N-F-F/N-F-G-A forge tick's BLUE engine). |

**Rule (CN-FORGE-04):** exactly one VRF transcript authority per era/protocol version; the Praos producer
alpha MUST equal the validator alpha. No both-alphas fallback. **The era→VRF construction chokepoint never
moves.**

### Domain: KES signing-key custody (real operator KES ingestion in `--mode node` since N-F-F)

| Layer | Module | Color | Role |
|-------|--------|-------|------|
| **Data-only loader (shared)** | `ade_runtime::producer::keys::load_kes_signing_key_skey` / `produce_mode::load_kes_skey_any_format` | RED | Reads the 608-byte cardano-cli skey envelope. `load_kes_skey_any_format` is `pub(crate)` (N-F-F) and REUSED verbatim by `operator_forge::load_operator_producer_shell` — no reimpl. |
| **Authoritative deserializer** | `ade_crypto::kes_sum::Sum6Kes::raw_deserialize_signing_key_kes` | BLUE | Byte layout is the structural validator. UNCHANGED. |
| **Authoritative algorithm** | `ade_crypto::kes_sum` | BLUE | Ade-native Sum6KES, byte-identical to Haskell `cardano-base`. UNCHANGED. |
| **Signing operation** | `ade_runtime::producer::signing` / `producer_shell::kes_sign_header` | RED | Sole key-custody surface; signs only the branded `UnsignedHeaderPreImage`. |
| **`--mode node` operator-material ingress (N-F-F; real parsers N-F-G-A)** | `ade_node::operator_forge::{load_operator_producer_shell, build_operator_forge_material}` | RED | The single named `--mode node` operator-material ingress site: REUSES the KES/VRF/cold loaders + (N-F-G-A) the real `parse_opcert_envelope` / `parse_shelley_genesis` → `ProducerShell::init` → `OperatorForgeMaterial` (custody shell, not `Debug`/`Serialize`). Key custody RED-confined to `ProducerShell`; passed only to the fenced `forge_one_from_recovered`, never copied/logged/serialized/hashed-for-evidence (CN-NODE-03). |

**Rule (CN-NODE-03):** the RED loader may not call `KesSecret::from_*` inside `load_kes_signing_key_skey` /
`operator_forge` — only the BLUE deserializer path. Signing is RED-confined; BLUE never signs. **N-F-F:
`--mode node` ingests REAL operator KES/VRF/cold/opcert material** via the single named `operator_forge`
ingress site, which REUSES the existing loaders (N-F-G-A: + the real opcert/genesis parsers; no reimpl, no
new BLUE authority, no plugin seam) and keeps custody confined to `ProducerShell`. The forge tick still
reuses `CoordinatorState::kes_period_for_slot`. **The custody/signing chokepoint never moves.**

### Domain: leader eligibility (RED/BLUE split)

| Layer | Module | Color | Role |
|-------|--------|-------|------|
| **VRF proof producer** | `ade_node::produce_mode` (prove-step) | RED | Produces the VRF proof/output over the BLUE answer's `expected_vrf_input.alpha_bytes()`. |
| **Authoritative evaluator** | `ade_core::consensus::leader_check::verify_and_evaluate_leader` | BLUE | Verifies + evaluates eligibility from canonical inputs only; emits the closed `LeaderCheckVerdict`. |

**Rule (CN-FORGE-02):** BLUE never sees the VRF/KES/cold keys; the evaluator has no
`LedgerView`/`EraSchedule`/`ChainDepState`/clock/storage/RED dep. The RED/BLUE split never moves.

### Domain: self-accept→serve handoff — typed carrier vs. single serve authority (GREEN carrier / RED sibling task / BLUE admit-behind-seams; N-F-G-B)

| Layer | Module | Color | Role |
|-------|--------|-------|------|
| **Data-only handoff carrier (constructor-fenced)** | `ade_runtime::producer::self_accepted_handoff::SelfAcceptedHandoff` (sole ctor `from_self_accepted`, accessors `accepted()` / `into_accepted()`) | GREEN | A constructor-fenced newtype over the BLUE `ade_ledger::producer::AcceptedBlock`. Private field; the SOLE constructor takes an `AcceptedBlock` (itself producible only by BLUE `self_accept` returning `Ok`). NO raw-bytes / `ForgedBlockArtifact` / `CoordinatorEvent` / flag / verdict constructor — a non-self-accepted artifact is type-unrepresentable as a handoff. Pure; carries the ORIGINAL token verbatim, never re-validates or re-derives it. Decides nothing; moves a token. |
| **Forge token surfacing** | `ade_node::produce_mode::run_real_forge` (+ `run_real_forge_inner`) / `ade_node::node_sync::forge_one_from_recovered` | RED | `run_real_forge` returns `(CoordinatorEvent, Option<AcceptedBlock>)` — `Some` iff `ForgeSucceeded` (the out-param is written only on the success path). `forge_one_from_recovered` returns `(CoordinatorEvent, Option<SelfAcceptedHandoff>)`, wrapping via `self_accepted.map(SelfAcceptedHandoff::from_self_accepted)`. The token is the ORIGINAL from BLUE `self_accept` (CN-FORGE-01), never re-derived from `artifact.bytes`. |
| **Typed handoff channel + sibling serve task** | `ade_node::node_lifecycle` (`ForgeActivation.handoff_tx: Option<mpsc::UnboundedSender<SelfAcceptedHandoff>>`, `with_handoff_sender`, the `tokio::spawn` sibling admit task) | RED | The relay-loop body forwards each surfaced handoff as a best-effort TYPED `tx.send(h)` ONLY — it holds ONLY the `Sender`, never a `ServedChainHandle` / `push_atomic` / served-chain mutation (so `ci_check_node_run_loop_containment.sh` stays byte-unchanged). The dispatcher On arm spawns a SIBLING task that drains the typed channel and admits via the single `ServedChainHandle::push_atomic(handoff.into_accepted())` — the SOLE node-spine `push_atomic` site. _(N-F-G-C BROADENED the fence's owner set to `{node_lifecycle.rs, node_sync.rs}` + flipped guard-3 to an allow-list.)_ |
| **Atomic publisher (reused)** | `ade_runtime::producer::served_chain_handle::push_atomic` | RED (GREEN-by-content glue) | The SAME single served-admit authority `produce_mode` uses; wraps `served_chain_admit` in `watch::Sender::send_modify` (no torn snapshot). REUSED unchanged — fed ONLY by `into_accepted()` on the node spine. |
| **Authoritative admit (reused, behind seams)** | `ade_ledger::producer::served_chain::served_chain_admit` | BLUE | The SOLE entry into the served index; only self-accepted blocks (CN-PROD-04). UNCHANGED — reached only via `push_atomic`. |

**Rule (DC-NODE-06 / CN-PROD-04 / CN-FORGE-01):** the self-accept→serve handoff is a **typed channel seam +
the single reused serve authority** — NO new BLUE authority, NO new canonical type, NO new `CoordinatorEvent`
variant. **Only a BLUE self-accepted artifact can be served:** the `SelfAcceptedHandoff`'s sole provenance is
the `AcceptedBlock` from `self_accept` (private-field constructor fence); raw bytes / a failed outcome / a flag
/ a peer verdict are type-unrepresentable. The relay-loop body does a **typed `tx.send` only** — served-chain
mutation lives in the SIBLING task via the single `push_atomic` fed by `into_accepted()`
(`ci_check_served_chain_handoff_fence.sh`, BROADENED by G-C: owners `{node_lifecycle.rs, node_sync.rs}`; every
node-spine `push_atomic(` fed by `into_accepted()`; no direct `served_chain_admit(`; the allow-list requires
every node-spine unbounded handoff channel to carry `SelfAcceptedHandoff`). **None of these chokepoints move**;
`ci_check_node_run_loop_containment.sh` is byte-/semantically unchanged. **Honest scope:** N-F-G-C adds the
LIVE FEED around this serve mechanism; a self-accepted block is served byte-identically over IN-PROCESS
block-fetch (`live_feed_forge_serve_loopback_returns_forged_block`), but a served block reaching a peer that
ACCEPTS it is the operator-gated RO-LIVE-01 leg. **No peer-acceptance / BA-02 / RO-LIVE claim; BA-02 satisfied
nowhere.**

### Domain: forged-block serving (data-only serve vs. authoritative admit)

| Layer | Module | Color | Role |
|-------|--------|-------|------|
| **Authoritative admit** | `ade_ledger::producer::served_chain::served_chain_admit` | BLUE | Sole entry into the served index; only self-accepted blocks (CN-PROD-04). |
| **Atomic publisher** | `ade_runtime::producer::served_chain_handle::push_atomic` | RED (GREEN-by-content glue) | Wraps `served_chain_admit` in `watch::Sender::send_modify` — no torn snapshot. |
| **Read-side serve** | `ade_network::block_fetch::server::producer_block_fetch_serve` | BLUE | Serves a `RequestRange` only if endpoints + every intervening block are present; emits the tag-24 composition (N-X). |

**Rule:** a forged block is visible to peers only after `push_atomic`; the read-side serve is data-only over
the BLUE `ServedChainSnapshot`. The serve emitter wraps via the single tag-24 authority before bytes reach a
peer (CN-WIRE-08). **N-F-E/N-F-F/N-F-G-A note:** the relay-loop forge tick **body** does NOT touch this serve
path — `served_chain_admit` / `push_atomic` are forbidden in the relay-loop body, even on the forge-CAPABLE On
arm. **N-F-G-B note (DC-NODE-06 ENFORCED):** the forge tick SURFACES the original BLUE self-accepted
`AcceptedBlock` and the loop body forwards it as a TYPED `mpsc<SelfAcceptedHandoff>` send to a dispatcher-spawned
SIBLING served-chain admit task; the sibling task — NOT the loop body — admits via the single `push_atomic`
(fed by `into_accepted()`). The loop body still references no serve token, so containment is byte-unchanged. See
the self-accept→serve handoff domain above. **N-F-G-C note:** a self-accepted block is now served byte-identically
over IN-PROCESS block-fetch on the live-feed path; a served block leaving the node over the wire to a peer that
ACCEPTS it is the operator-gated RO-LIVE-01 leg (peer ACCEPT NOT claimed here).

## 3. Closed vs. Extensible Registries

### Closed (frozen — version-gated changes only)

| Registry | Location | Count | Change Rule |
|----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `SessionError::ReassemblyBufferOverflow` *(NEW, N-F-G-E)* | `ade_network::session::event` (GREEN-by-content) | additive variant `{ protocol, len, cap }` on the closed `SessionError` enum | The closed fail-closed signal for an incomplete per-mini-protocol reassembly tail over `MAX_REASSEMBLY_TAIL_BYTES`. Added **additively** — there is **NO wildcard**; the SOLE exhaustive consumer `ade_runtime::network::mux_pump::session_err_to_halt` maps it → `PeerHaltReason::ChainSyncDecodeError` (drop the peer). The cap fires **BEFORE** the BLUE `ade_codec` decode path — no silent truncation, no partial decode. `session/` is GREEN-by-content (NOT a BLUE `ade_network` submodule path), so the variant is **NOT canonical-counted**. **A closed additive enum variant (a surface REDUCTION / fail-closed bound), NOT an extension point.** New variant = a `SessionError` arm + a `session_err_to_halt` arm (no wildcard) + a strengthening of **DC-LIVEMEM-01** (`ci_check_live_feed_memory_bounds.sh`). |
| `MAX_REASSEMBLY_TAIL_BYTES` (closed memory bound) *(NEW, N-F-G-E)* | `ade_network::session::core` (GREEN-by-content, `core.rs:49`) | closed literal const `16 * 1024 * 1024` (16 MiB) | The per-mini-protocol reassembly-tail cap. After `drain_protocol_items` drains every COMPLETE item, `buf.len() > MAX_REASSEMBLY_TAIL_BYTES` ⇒ `SessionError::ReassemblyBufferOverflow` (fail closed, drop the peer). A **CLOSED LITERAL constant — a defensive implementation bound, NOT a Cardano semantic parameter**; **NO runtime / CLI / env / config override** (the no-escape-hatch surface reduction, `ci_check_live_feed_memory_bounds.sh` guard 3). A future hardening slice may **tighten** it (a strengthening of **DC-LIVEMEM-01**), but may NEVER make it a tunable / unbounded. |
| `MAX_WIRE_PUMP_LOOKAHEAD` (closed lookahead-depth bound) *(NEW, N-F-G-E)* | `ade_node::node_sync` (RED, `node_sync.rs:58`) | closed literal const `256` | The WirePump opportunistic-drain depth cap. `pump_lookahead` stops the `try_recv` drain at the cap (`node_sync.rs:126`), so the existing bounded `mpsc` (`LIVE_WIRE_PUMP_CHANNEL_CAP = 64`) **back-pressures** the pump. Content-blind; the verdict-decoupled `NodeBlockSource` (closed 2-variant `{WirePump, InMemory}`) + arrival order are **unchanged** (a depth cap on the existing opaque `VecDeque<Vec<u8>>`, NOT a new variant / source / verdict). A **CLOSED LITERAL constant — a defensive implementation bound**; **NO runtime / CLI / env / config override** (`ci_check_live_feed_memory_bounds.sh` guard 3). A future hardening slice may **tighten** it (a strengthening of **DC-LIVEMEM-01**), never make it a tunable / unbounded. |
| `NodeBlockSource` *(N-F-C; readiness extended N-F-D; LIVE WirePump FILL N-F-G-C)* | `ade_node::node_sync` (RED) | 2 (`WirePump` / `InMemory`) | The **verdict-decoupled** ordered peer-block source: `next_block` yields ONLY `AdmissionPeerEvent::Block` bytes, SKIPS `TipUpdate`, ends on `Disconnected`. N-F-D added a content-blind readiness signal. **N-F-G-C added `from_wire_pump(rx)` — a LIVE FILL of the existing `WirePump` arm fed by `spawn_live_wire_pump_source` (reusing the closed admission dial + pump VERBATIM); NOT a new variant, NOT a new wire authority, NOT a plugin point.** NEVER carries a verdict. A closed single-method contract. New variant = a `next_block` arm + a strengthening of **DC-SYNC-01 / DC-SYNC-02**; a new source must REUSE the closed dial/pump (never reimplement), FILL an existing arm, advance no second tip, and carry no verdict. |
| `ba02_pass` evidence I/O *(NEW, N-F-G-C S2)* | `ade_node::ba02_pass` (RED — `//! RED`) | 2 fns (`correlate_peer_log_file`, `write_ba02_manifest`); **NO new closed enum / registry** | The RED operator-pass BA-02 evidence file I/O over the pre-existing closed `Ba02Manifest` / `BA02Outcome` / `PeerAcceptEvent` / `NoEvidenceReason` vocabulary. `correlate_peer_log_file` reads the operator-captured peer-log file → the GREEN `correlate` (the SOLE `Ba02Manifest` ctor); `write_ba02_manifest` accepts **ONLY a `Ba02Manifest`** — so a written manifest is ALWAYS correlate-produced. **A CLOSED file-I/O wrapper (a surface REDUCTION over the existing closed evidence vocabulary), NOT a new closed enum / registry / plugin point.** A missing/unreadable file fails closed (`io::Error`). Backs the BA-02 leg of `RO-LIVE-06` / `CN-OPERATOR-EVIDENCE-01`. Gate: `ci_check_ba02_evidence_manifest_schema.sh` (the no-synthetic-manifest enforcer; vacuous-until-committed + 8-field schema + `peer_log_file_sha256` cross-check). Adding an evidence-I/O fn = a strengthening of RO-LIVE-06; **no new acceptance source, no path emitting a manifest from `NoEvidence` / raw operator input.** |
| `SelfAcceptedHandoff` *(N-F-G-B S1)* | `ade_runtime::producer::self_accepted_handoff` (GREEN) | constructor-fenced newtype (1 private field `accepted: AcceptedBlock`; SOLE ctor `from_self_accepted`; accessors `accepted()` / `into_accepted()`) | The typed carrier moving a BLUE self-accepted forged block from the forge path to the sibling serve task. Its **SOLE constructor** takes a BLUE `ade_ledger::producer::AcceptedBlock` (itself producible only by BLUE `self_accept` returning `Ok`); the field is private. There is **NO** constructor from a raw `Vec<u8>`, a `ForgedBlockArtifact` (`artifact.bytes` is never a token source — re-deriving would breach CN-FORGE-01; the carrier holds the ORIGINAL token), a `CoordinatorEvent`, a self-declared acceptance flag, or a peer verdict — so handing the serve task a non-self-accepted artifact is **type-unrepresentable**. A **CLOSED constructor-fenced carrier (a surface REDUCTION), NOT an extensible registry / plugin point.** Backs `DC-NODE-06`. A change to the carried type / a new accessor = a strengthening of **DC-NODE-06 / CN-PROD-04 / CN-FORGE-01** (`ci_check_served_chain_handoff_fence.sh`, BROADENED by G-C); **no raw-bytes / artifact / event / flag / verdict constructor may be introduced**. |
| `SlotAlignmentError` *(N-F-G-A S3)* | `ade_runtime::clock` (GREEN-by-content) | 1 (`BeforeGenesisAnchor`) | The closed fail-closed boundary carried by `checked_millis_to_slot`. A before-anchor tick (`tick_millis < start_millis`) is an *error*, never a saturation to `start_slot`. A **surface REDUCTION (a closed fail-closed wall)**, NOT a plugin/extension point. New variant = a `checked_millis_to_slot` arm + a strengthening of **DC-EPOCH-03**. |
| `ProtocolParamsParseError` *(N-F-G-A S2a)* | `ade_runtime::consensus_inputs::protocol_params` (GREEN-by-content) | closed sum (incl. `JsonShape` / `InexactRational { field: &'static str }`) | The closed error set of the cardano-cli `query protocol-parameters` JSON parser. **No float path** — a rational literal that cannot be represented exactly by integer arithmetic fails closed (`InexactRational`); a bad shape ⇒ `JsonShape`. Carries only non-secret `&'static str` field tags. A **surface REDUCTION (a closed RED-parse → BLUE-`ProtocolParameters` pipeline)**, NOT an extension point. New variant = a `parse_protocol_parameters_json` arm + a strengthening of **CE-G-A-2a** (`ci_check_recovered_ledger_pparams_sourced.sh`); non-secret primitives only; **no float path may be introduced**. |
| `ForgeCurrentPParamsError` *(N-F-G-A S2a)* | `ade_runtime::consensus_inputs::canonical` (GREEN-by-content) | 3 (`PreimageAbsent` / `BindMismatch` / `Parse(ProtocolParamsParseError)`) | The closed error set of `require_forge_current_pparams`. `LiveConsensusInputsCanonical` carries `protocol_params_json: Option<String>` **OUTSIDE** the frozen 15-field canonical fingerprint (which commits to `protocol_params_hash`); the accessor requires the preimage present (`PreimageAbsent`), `blake2b_256`-binds it to the fingerprinted hash (`BindMismatch`), and parses exactly (`Parse`). A hash-bound accessor, NOT an extension point. New variant = a strengthening of **CE-G-A-2a**; **the preimage MUST stay OUTSIDE the 15-field canonical CBOR fingerprint** (no fingerprint-schema change). |
| `ForgeEpochAdmission` *(N-F-G-A S4)* | `ade_node::node_sync` (GREEN-by-fn inside RED `node_sync`) | 2 (`WithinSeedEpoch` / `OffEpoch { located, seed }`) | The closed off-epoch admission verdict carried by `forge_epoch_admission`, derived SOLELY from `(slot, era_schedule, seed_epoch)` via the BLUE `EraSchedule::locate`. An off-epoch / unlocatable slot is an *error* (`OffEpoch`), never a third variant. Called BEFORE `query_leader_schedule` inside `forge_one_from_recovered`. A **closed classifier vocabulary**, NOT an extension point. New variant = a `forge_epoch_admission` arm + a strengthening of **DC-EPOCH-03** (`ci_check_node_forge_single_epoch_fail_closed.sh` — must use `EraSchedule::locate`, no fabricated epoch, no nonce promotion). |
| `CoordinatorEvent` *(DELIBERATELY NOT EXTENDED, N-F-G-A S4)* | `ade_runtime::producer::coordinator` (GREEN) | 9 (`SlotTick` / `ForgeSucceeded` / `ForgeNotLeader` / `ForgeFailed` / `PeerConnected` / `PeerDisconnected` / `LedgerSnapshotUpdated` / `BroadcastDrained` / `Shutdown`) | The closed coordinator event set. **S4 reused the existing `ForgeNotLeader` for the off-epoch outcome — NO new variant added.** N-F-G-B surfaced the self-accepted token via a **sibling return component**, NOT a new event variant. N-F-G-C added **NO** `CoordinatorEvent` variant. An off-epoch forge is surfaced as a "not leader" outcome through the closed vocabulary, keeping the set additively stable. New variant = a strengthening of **DC-PROD-01**; closed JSONL vocab, no free-form reason strings, no key material. |
| `ForgeIntent` *(N-F-F)* | `ade_node::forge_intent` (GREEN) | 2 (`On(ForgePaths)` / `Off`) | The closed tri-state forge-intent classification the `--mode node` arm keys its forge-on flip off. `classify_forge_intent` is the SOLE entry; **NO third "partial" variant** — a partial key set is `Err(ForgeIntentError::PartialKeySet)`. Pure/total over all 2⁵ flag-PRESENCE combinations (never observes contents). A **CE-not-law additively-closed classifier** (like `WalEntry` / `LoopStep`). New variant = a `classify_forge_intent` arm (bound by name, no wildcard) + a `node_lifecycle` dispatch arm + a strengthening of **CN-NODE-03** (`ci_check_forge_intent_closed.sh`). |
| `ForgeIntentError` *(N-F-F)* | `ade_node::forge_intent` (GREEN) | 1 (`PartialKeySet { present, missing }`) | The closed forge-intent classify error — carries ONLY static CLI flag-name strings (`&'static str`), never a supplied path string, never key material. New variant = a strengthening of **CN-NODE-03**; static flag-name strings only (`ci_check_forge_intent_closed.sh`). |
| `OperatorForgeError` *(N-F-F)* | `ade_node::operator_forge` (RED) | 6 (`ColdKeyLoad` / `VrfKeyLoad` / `KesKeyLoad` / `OpcertParse` / `ShellInit` / `GenesisParse`) | The closed operator-material ingress error sum — one variant per reused-loader / structural-validator step. Carries no path/key bytes (`OpcertParse`/`GenesisParse` hold `&'static str` detail only). _(N-F-G-A: details now come from the REAL `parse_opcert_envelope` / `parse_shelley_genesis`.)_ New variant = a strengthening of **CN-NODE-03 / OP-OPS-04**; non-secret primitives only (`ci_check_operator_forge_no_secret_leak.sh`). |
| `OperatorForgeMaterial` *(N-F-F)* | `ade_node::operator_forge` (RED) | closed struct (`shell: ProducerShell` / `genesis: GenesisAnchor` / `pool_id: Hash28` / `pparams` / `protocol_version` / `anchor_millis` / `start_slot` / `slot_length_ms`) | The operator-material forge inputs. **Deliberately NOT `Debug`/`Serialize`** (holds the custody `ProducerShell`); no byte accessor / serialization / logging. `pool_id` derived in ONE named place (`blake2b_224(cold_vk)`). A **CE-not-law additively-closed struct**. A new field = a struct addition behind the closed ingress contract + a strengthening of **CN-NODE-03** (`ci_check_operator_forge_no_secret_leak.sh`). |
| `LoopStep` *(EXTENDED 3→4, N-F-E)* | `ade_node::run_loop_planner` (GREEN) | 4 (`SyncOnce` / `ForgeTick` / `Idle` / `HaltCleanly`) | The closed live-run iteration vocabulary the GREEN planner emits. **N-F-E added `ForgeTick`** (3→4). It **cannot express an authority decision**. A **CE-not-law additively-evolvable closed planner enum** (like `WalEntry`). New variant = a `plan_loop_step` arm + a fenced RED `run_relay_loop` branch + a strengthening of **CN-NODE-02 / DC-NODE-05** (`ci_check_loop_planner_closed.sh` + `ci_check_node_run_loop_containment.sh`). |
| `ForgeSlotStatus` *(N-F-E)* | `ade_node::run_loop_planner` (GREEN) | 2 (`Due` / `NotDue`) | The **content-blind** forge-slot planner input. The planner learns only whether a slot is *due*, NEVER who is a leader (eligibility is BLUE inside `forge_one_from_recovered`). Derived by the pure `forge_slot_status` monotonic guard (the only `SlotNo`-observing fn in the module). New variant = a `plan_loop_step` arm + a strengthening of **DC-NODE-05** (`ci_check_loop_planner_closed.sh`). |
| `ForgeActivation` *(N-F-E; real operator material N-F-F; current pparams N-F-G-A; opt-in `handoff_tx` N-F-G-B)* | `ade_node::node_lifecycle` (RED) | closed opt-in struct (`clock` / `coordinator_state` / `recovered` / `shell` / `pool_id` / `pparams` / `protocol_version` / `anchor_millis` / `start_slot` / `slot_length_ms` / `last_slot_alignment_fail` / `handoff_tx: Option<mpsc::UnboundedSender<SelfAcceptedHandoff>>` / private `last_forged_slot`+`pending_slot` / `hermetic_forge_outcomes`) | The **opt-in forge-activation bundle** threaded into `run_relay_loop` as `forge: Option<&mut ForgeActivation>`. `Some` activates exactly one fenced `forge_one_from_recovered` per `ForgeTick`, advancing no durable tip and serving/admitting/gossiping nothing in the loop body; `None` reproduces N-F-D relay. N-F-G-B: the opt-in `handoff_tx` carries the surfaced `SelfAcceptedHandoff` to the sibling serve task (set via `with_handoff_sender`). **A closed activation surface, NOT an extension point.** A new field = a struct addition behind the closed activation contract + a strengthening of **DC-NODE-05 / DC-NODE-06**. |
| `Mode` (run-mode set) *(N-F-C)* | `ade_node::cli` (RED) | 5 (`WireOnly` / `Admission` / `KeyGenKes` / `Produce` / `Node`) | The CLOSED `--mode` taxonomy. **NOT `#[non_exhaustive]`**; `Mode::parse` + `main.rs` dispatch are total with **NO wildcard arm**. New variant = a `Mode::parse` arm + an explicit wildcard-free `main.rs` arm + a strengthening of **CN-NODE-MODE-01** (`ci_check_node_mode_closure.sh`). _(N-F-F/N-F-G-A/N-F-G-C added NO `Mode` variant — the operator-key + `--peer` flags are OPTIONAL ingress on the existing `--mode node` arm.)_ |
| `PeerAcceptEvent` *(N-F-C; consumed via `ba02_pass` N-F-G-C)* | `ade_node::ba02_evidence` (GREEN) | 2 (`PeerServedBlock` / `PeerChainTip`) | The CLOSED **allow-list** of peer-acceptance signals; `parse_peer_accept_events` recognizes ONLY these two discriminators. UNCHANGED by N-F-G-C (only consumed by the new RED `ba02_pass` I/O). New variant = a parser allow-list arm + a strengthening of **RO-LIVE-06**. |
| `PeerAcceptSource` *(N-F-C)* | `ade_node::ba02_evidence` (GREEN) | 3 (`ServedBlock` / `ChainTip` / `ServedBlockAndChainTip`) | The closed typed provenance of the accepting signal. New variant = a `correlate` source arm + a strengthening of RO-LIVE-06. |
| `NoEvidenceReason` *(N-F-C)* | `ade_node::ba02_evidence` (GREEN) | 4 (`NoPeerAccept` / `HashMismatch` / `ChainPointMismatch` / `ConflictingPeerSignals`) | The closed reason sum for `BA02Outcome::NoEvidence` — NoEvidence is the DEFAULT. New variant = a `correlate` classify arm + a strengthening of RO-LIVE-06. |
| `BA02Outcome` *(N-F-C; consumed via `ba02_pass` N-F-G-C)* | `ade_node::ba02_evidence` (GREEN) | 2 (`Ba02Manifest(Ba02Manifest)` / `NoEvidence { reason }`) | The closed correlation outcome. `correlate` is the **SOLE** `Ba02Manifest` constructor; no self-evidence acceptance source; no committed synthetic manifest (**RO-LIVE-06**). UNCHANGED by N-F-G-C — `ba02_pass::write_ba02_manifest` accepts ONLY the `Ba02Manifest` arm. |
| `Ba02Manifest` schema *(N-F-C; schema gate N-F-G-C)* | `ade_node::ba02_evidence` (GREEN) | versioned struct — `BA02_MANIFEST_SCHEMA_VERSION = 1` | A **version-GATED** canonical evidence manifest (see §4); SOLE constructor `correlate`'s exact-match arm (RO-LIVE-06). N-F-G-C added the committed-manifest schema gate `ci_check_ba02_evidence_manifest_schema.sh` (8 fields + `schema_version == 1` + `peer_log_file_sha256` cross-check; vacuous-until-committed). |
| `NodeLifecycleError` *(N-F-C; +RelaySync N-F-D; +ForgeKeyIngress N-F-F; +MissingFlag live-feed N-F-G-C)* | `ade_node::node_lifecycle` (RED) | closed sum (incl. `RelaySync`, `ForgeKeyIngress(String)`, `MissingFlag(&'static str)`) | The closed fail-closed lifecycle-owner error set (Mithril-only, no genesis/bundle/cold/graft fallback). N-F-F added `ForgeKeyIngress(String)` (→ exit 44); N-F-G-C uses `MissingFlag("--network-magic")` on the live-feed arm. New variant = a strengthening of **CN-NODE-01 / CN-NODE-02 / CN-NODE-03**. |
| `NodeStart` *(N-F-C)* | `ade_node::node_lifecycle` (RED) | 2 (`FirstRun` / `WarmStart`) | The closed start classification — a PURE function of on-disk state. No third "ambiguous" mode. New variant = a strengthening of CN-NODE-01. |
| `NodeSyncError` *(N-F-C)* | `ade_node::node_sync` (RED) | 2 (`Pump(String)` / `Capture(String)`) | The closed sync-driver fail-closed halt set. New variant = a strengthening of **DC-SYNC-01 / DC-SYNC-02**. |
| `NodeForgeError` *(N-F-C; exercised by the N-F-E forge tick + N-F-F On arm + N-F-G-A tick)* | `ade_node::node_sync` (RED) | 1 (`MissingRecoveredConsensusInputs`) | The closed forge-handoff fail-closed set: a forge over a base that carries NO recovered seed-epoch record is unrepresentable. New variant = a strengthening of **CN-CINPUT-03 / DC-CINPUT-02b / DC-NODE-05**. |
| `SeedEpochConsensusInputs` *(N-F-A)* | `ade_ledger::seed_consensus_inputs` (BLUE) | closed canonical record; **version-gated** behind `SEED_CINPUT_SCHEMA_VERSION = 1` | The recovered seed-epoch consensus-input record with a **SOLE** encoder/decoder pair. `decode_*` rejects any version != the constant fail-closed, and rejects a structurally-valid-but-non-canonical buffer. No `Default`, no `#[non_exhaustive]`, `BTreeMap`. New field / version = a `decode_*` arm + a `SEED_CINPUT_SCHEMA_VERSION` bump + a strengthening of **CN-CINPUT-01**. No second codec. |
| `SeedConsensusInputsError` *(N-F-A)* | `ade_ledger::seed_consensus_inputs` (BLUE) | 6 (`MalformedCbor` / `UnknownVersion` / `Structural` / `NonCanonicalMapOrder` / `DuplicatePoolKey` / `TrailingBytes`) | The closed `decode_*` failure set. New variant = a strengthening of **CN-CINPUT-01**; non-secret primitives only; MUST fail closed. |
| `SeedConsensusMergeError` *(N-F-A)* | `ade_runtime::seed_consensus_merge` (GREEN) | 2 (`PoolMissingVrfKeyhash` / `PoolMissingStake`) | A pool present in exactly one source map fails closed here, **never a zero-hash fill**. New variant = a strengthening of the merge contract (CN-CINPUT-02). No catch-all. |
| `SeedEpochConsensusSource` *(N-F-A; CONSUME-side wired N-F-C)* | `ade_runtime::bootstrap` (RED) | 2 (`NotRequired` / `RequiredFromRecoveredProvenance(RecoveredBootstrapProvenance)`) | The input-mode discriminant for warm-start. The `--mode node` WarmStart arm passes `RequiredFromRecoveredProvenance`; its construction is contained to {lifecycle owner, `bootstrap.rs`}. New variant = a strengthening of DC-CINPUT-01. |
| `BootstrapError` (N-F-A new variants) | `ade_runtime::bootstrap` (RED) | +5 (`SeedConsensusProvenanceMissing` / `SeedConsensusSidecarMissing` / `SeedConsensusHashMismatch` / `SeedConsensusBindingMismatch` / `SeedConsensusSidecarDecode`) | The fail-closed warm-start-restore failure set; MUST NOT fall back to the forge-time bundle. New variant = a strengthening of **DC-CINPUT-01**; non-secret primitives only. |
| `MithrilBootstrapError` *(N-Z; +N-F-A SeedConsensus* variants)* | `ade_runtime::mithril_bootstrap` (RED) | 3 base + N-F-A `SeedConsensus*` | The closed RED-composition error sum — one variant per composed step. No catch-all/`String`; the binding step is the SOLE semantic decision (BLUE). |
| `MithrilSeedPointInputs` *(N-Z)* | `ade_runtime::mithril_bootstrap` (RED) | closed struct | The **operator-provided, structurally-independent** seed-point origin (DC-MITHRIL-02). A new attested field = a struct addition + a strengthening of DC-MITHRIL-02. |
| `MithrilBootstrapOutput` *(N-Z)* | `ade_runtime::mithril_bootstrap` (RED) | closed struct (`ledger` / `chain_dep` / `tip` / `anchor`) | A new field = a struct addition behind the composition contract. |
| `SeedProvenance` *(N-Y; UNCHANGED through N-F-G-C)* | `ade_ledger::bootstrap_anchor::anchor` (BLUE) | 2 (`CardanoCliJson` / `Mithril { … }`) | **Version-gated** behind `ANCHOR_SCHEMA_VERSION = 2`. Closed — no open/wildcard variant. New variant = a `decode_bootstrap_anchor` arm + an `ANCHOR_SCHEMA_VERSION` bump + a strengthening of **CN-ANCHOR-01 / DC-ANCHOR-01**. |
| `MithrilImportError` *(N-Y)* | `ade_ledger::bootstrap_anchor::binding` (BLUE) | 5 | The closed `verify_mithril_binding` failure set. New variant = a strengthening of **CN-MITHRIL-01 / DC-MITHRIL-01**; MUST fail closed. |
| `MithrilManifestReport` *(N-Y)* | `ade_ledger::bootstrap_anchor::binding` (BLUE) | closed struct | A new attested field = a struct addition + a strengthening of the binding predicate's cross-check. |
| `GenesisSourceError` *(N-Y)* | `ade_ledger::genesis_source` (BLUE) | 1 load-bearing (`NonConwayEra`) | `genesis_initial_state` is Conway-only. New variant = a strengthening of **DC-GENESIS-SRC-01**. |
| `SyncEffect` *(N-Y)* | `ade_runtime::forward_sync::reducer` (GREEN-by-content) | 4 (`StoreBlockBytes` / `AppendWal` / `CommitCheckpoint` / `AdvanceTip`) | The closed forward-sync effect plan. `AdvanceTip` is unreachable before `StoreBlockBytes` + `AppendWal`. New variant = a reducer arm + a pump apply-step + a strengthening of **DC-SYNC-01**. |
| `MithrilManifestError` *(N-Y)* | `ade_runtime::mithril_import::importer` (RED) | closed sum | The closed manifest-JSON parse failure set. No semantic decision. |
| `PumpError` *(N-Y)* | `ade_runtime::forward_sync::pump` (RED) | closed sum (incl. `TipBeforeDurable`) | New variant = a strengthening of **DC-SYNC-01**. |
| `NodeRecoveryError` *(N-Y)* | `ade_runtime::recovery::restart` (RED) | closed sum (incl. `WalTailFingerprintMismatch`) | A WAL-tail fingerprint divergence fails fast. New variant = a strengthening of the recovery contract / **DC-WAL-***. |
| `BlockVerdict` (observable surface) *(N-Y)* | `ade_testkit::harness::sync_diff` (GREEN) | 2 (`Admitted` / `Rejected`) | Compared on observable surfaces only (DC-COMPAT-01). New variant = a strengthening of **DC-COMPAT-01 / RO-SYNC-EVIDENCE-01**. |
| `RegressionFixtureViolation` *(N-Y)* | `ade_testkit::harness::sync_diff` (GREEN) | closed sum | New variant = a strengthening of **RO-SYNC-EVIDENCE-01**. |
| `TagEnvelopeError` *(N-X)* | `ade_codec::cbor::tag24` (BLUE) | 4 (`NotTag24` / `NotByteString` / `Truncated` / `TrailingBytes`) | New variant = a strengthening of **CN-WIRE-08**; non-secret offset/length primitives only. |
| `ExpectedVrfInput` *(N-W)* | `ade_core::consensus::vrf_cert` (BLUE) | 2 (`Praos([u8;32])` / `Tpraos([u8;41])`) | The 2-variant enum IS the protocol-family tag. New variant = a `leader_vrf_input` arm + a strengthening of **CN-FORGE-04**. |
| `LeaderCheckVerdict` *(N-R-A)* | `ade_core::consensus::leader_check` (BLUE) | 2 (`Eligible` / `NotEligible`) | New variant = a strengthening of **CN-FORGE-02**; `NotEligible` carries only a bounded fingerprint. |
| `ForgeFailureReason` *(extended N-W)* | `ade_runtime::producer::producer_log` (GREEN) | closed sum incl. `UnsupportedProducerEra` | New variant = a strengthening of **CN-FORGE-04 / DC-PROD-01**. |
| `OutboundCommand` *(N-S-B)* | `ade_runtime::network::outbound_command` (RED) | typed `ChainSyncServerMsg` / `BlockFetchServerMsg` | New variant = a new typed mini-protocol reply. **No `Vec<u8>` byte tunnel** (CN-OUTBOUND-RELAY-01). |
| `DispatchError` *(N-S-B)* | `ade_node::produce_mode` + `ade_runtime::network::n2n_server` (RED) | closed sum | No `String`/catch-all variant (CN-PEER-OUTBOUND-MAP-01). |
| `ChainEvolutionError` *(N-T)* | `ade_runtime::producer::chain_evolution` (GREEN) | closed sum | New variant = a strengthening of **DC-PROD-03**. |

| `ProducerLogEvent` *(N-Q)* | `ade_runtime::producer::producer_log` (GREEN) | closed JSONL vocab | New variant = a strengthening of **DC-PROD-01**. No free-form reason strings, no key material. |
| `GenesisParseError` *(N-R-C; reused on the node path N-F-G-A)* | `ade_runtime::producer::genesis_parser` (RED) | closed sum | New variant = a strengthening of **CN-GENESIS-01**. The N-F-G-A `operator_forge` ingress reuses `parse_shelley_genesis` (this error type) on the node path. |
| `OpCertParseError` *(N-R-C; reused on the node path N-F-G-A)* | `ade_runtime::producer::opcert_envelope` (RED) | closed sum | New variant = a strengthening of **CN-OPCERT-01**. The N-F-G-A `operator_forge` ingress reuses `parse_opcert_envelope` (this error type) on the node path. |
| `UnsignedHeaderPreImageError` *(N-S-A)* | `ade_ledger::block_validity::unsigned_header_pre_image` (BLUE) | closed sum | New variant = a strengthening of **DC-KES-HEADER-01**. |
| `AcceptedMiniProtocol` *(N-L)* | `ade_network::session` (GREEN) | closed registry | New mini-protocol = a registry entry + a `match` arm with **no wildcard accept**. |
| `KesError` / `KesParseError` *(N-P)* | `ade_crypto::kes_sum::errors` (BLUE) | 5 / 6 variants | New variant = a strengthening of **DC-CRYPTO-08/09**; non-secret primitives only. |
| Operator-evidence manifest TOML schema *(N-S-C)* | `ci_check_operator_evidence_manifest_schema.sh` + `docs/clusters/completed/PHASE4-N-S-C/cluster.md` | closed key set | Any committed `CE-N-S-LIVE_*.toml` MUST conform (CN-OPERATOR-EVIDENCE-01). |
| BA-02 operator-pass manifest TOML schema *(NEW, N-F-G-C)* | `ci_check_ba02_evidence_manifest_schema.sh` + `docs/clusters/PHASE4-N-F-G-C/CE-G-C-LIVE_*.toml` | closed 8-key set (`schema_version` / `block_hash` / `slot` / `peer_log_file` / `peer_log_file_sha256` / `peer_log_capture_command` / `peer_log_filter` / `accept_event_kind`) | Any committed `CE-G-C-LIVE_*.toml` MUST conform (`schema_version == 1`) AND its `peer_log_file_sha256` MUST match the actual SHA-256 of the committed peer-log fixture it binds (CN-OPERATOR-EVIDENCE-01 / RO-LIVE-06). **Vacuously satisfied when none is committed** (the typical state — the live operator pass is `blocked_until_operator_stake_available`). The no-synthetic-manifest enforcer. |
| Sync-evidence manifest schema *(N-Y)* | `ci_check_sync_evidence_manifest_schema.sh` + `corpus/sync/regressions/` | closed key set | Mirrors the operator-evidence pattern; vacuously satisfied until a manifest is committed (RO-SYNC-EVIDENCE-01, **partial**). |
| `CardanoEra` + Conway cert / governance / withdrawal enums | `ade_types::{era, conway::*}` + `ade_codec::conway::*` | closed | New era / cert / gov-action = a versioned gate (DC-LEDGER-08/09/10/11). `is_praos()` classifies exactly {Babbage, Conway}. |
| Consensus message + verdict enums | `ade_core::consensus`, `ade_ledger::block_validity` / `tx_validity` | closed | `ci_check_consensus_closed_enums.sh` — `match` with no wildcard. |
| JSONL event vocabularies (admission / wire-only / live-log) | `ade_node::{admission_log, live_log}`, `ade_runtime::admission` | closed | New event = a strengthening of the owning DC rule; allow-list + negative tests. |

### Extensible (open within constraints)

| Registry | Location | Extension Rule |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| Ade-native WAL (append-only) | `ade_runtime::wal` (GREEN-by-content) + `ade_ledger::wal::event` (BLUE encoder/decoder) | Append-only; committed entries are never mutated (`ci_check_wal_append_only.sh`). **`WalEntry` is a deliberately CE-not-law surface** — additively evolvable behind the WAL schema (append-only wire tags; `AdmitBlock` = 0, `SeedEpochConsensusInputsImported` = 3, tags 1/2 reserved). An acceptance criterion, NOT a frozen registry-law enum. |
| Seed-epoch sidecar store (anchor-fp-keyed) *(N-F-A; consumed N-F-C)* | `ade_runtime::chaindb::SnapshotStore::{put,get,list}_seed_epoch_consensus_*` | A new entry is `put` only on the verified-bootstrap composition path, keyed by `anchor_fp` in a namespace disjoint from the slot-keyed snapshot space; idempotent on identical bytes (redb `seed_cinputs_by_anchor_fp` table, `SCHEMA_VERSION = 3`). N-F-C consumes it via `list_seed_epoch_consensus_anchor_fps` + `get_seed_epoch_consensus_inputs` on the WarmStart arm. The forge-time path may NOT `put` here (CN-CINPUT-02). |
| `PerPeerOutbound` map *(N-S-B)* | `ade_runtime::network::outbound_command` — `Arc<RwLock<BTreeMap<PeerId, mpsc::Sender<OutboundCommand>>>>` | Grows at runtime; **`BTreeMap`, not `HashMap`** — deterministic iteration; no cross-peer byte leakage (CN-PEER-OUTBOUND-MAP-01, DC-OUTBOUND-FIFO-01). |
| `OpCertCounterMap` | `ade_core::consensus::praos_state` (BLUE) | Grows as op-certs are observed; deterministic ordering. |
| `ServedChainSnapshot` (served blocks) | `ade_ledger::producer::served_chain` (BLUE) | Grows via `served_chain_admit` only; `push_atomic` is the sole publisher. (The N-F-E/N-F-F/N-F-G-A relay-loop forge tick does NOT publish here; N-F-G-B publishes via the sibling task's single `push_atomic` fed by `into_accepted()`.) |
| `MempoolState` (admitted txs) | `ade_ledger::mempool` (BLUE) | Grows via `mempool_ingress` → `admit` only; sorted/deduplicated. |
| Seed entries (imported UTxO) | `ade_runtime::seed_import` (GREEN-by-content) | Grows at import time from a cardano-cli UTxO dump; canonical decoders only. |
| Persisted ChainDb (synced blocks) *(N-Y; first production driver N-F-C; driven by the N-F-D loop; LIVE feed N-F-G-C)* | `ade_runtime::chaindb` via `forward_sync::pump` | Grows via the forward-sync pump applying the GREEN reducer's `SyncEffect` plan in durable order; the tip advances only after `StoreBlockBytes` + `AppendWal` ack (DC-SYNC-01). N-F-C's `node_sync::run_node_sync` is the first production driver; the N-F-D relay loop drives it each `SyncOnce` iteration; N-F-G-C feeds it a LIVE `--peer` source (reusing the closed admission dial + pump). |
| Sync regression fixtures *(N-Y)* | `corpus/sync/regressions/` | Each discovered Haskell observable-surface mismatch is committed as a named regression fixture (RO-SYNC-EVIDENCE-01). |
| Sum_n KES family | `ade_crypto::kes_sum` (BLUE) | A new `Sum_n` attaches as an internal type-alias step; the `KesAlgorithm` trait surface does not change. |
| Per-protocol tag-24 compositions *(N-X)* | `ade_network::codec::{block_fetch, chain_sync}` | A new CBOR-in-CBOR composition attaches as a `compose_*` / `decompose_*` pair delegating to the single `ade_codec::{wrap_tag24, unwrap_tag24}` authority (CN-WIRE-08). |
| Bootstrap-source production compositions *(N-Z; +N-F-A sidecar tail)* | `ade_runtime::{genesis_bootstrap, mithril_bootstrap}` | A new bootstrap-source production entry attaches as a **composition-only RED twin** of `bootstrap_from_{conway_genesis, mithril_snapshot}`: import/parse + (if a point is attested) mint the anchor from an operator-independent origin + verify-before-bootstrap (fail-closed) + route through the single `bootstrap_initial_state` authority + the N-F-A sidecar tail. **No new authority, no new `*Anchor` trait/plugin, no new `SeedProvenance` variant unless the source genuinely differs** (CN-MITHRIL-01 / CN-NODE-01 / DC-MITHRIL-02 / CN-CINPUT-02). |

## 4. Version-Gated vs. Frozen Contracts

### Frozen (immutable at current version — change = new major version)

- **Live-feed peer-driven memory is bounded BEFORE authoritative decode/apply by two closed literal caps
  (N-F-G-E, DC-LIVEMEM-01 — load-bearing; do NOT soften / do NOT broaden).** Two closed constants, each
  fail-closed in front of the BLUE `ade_codec` decode path, with **NO runtime / CLI / env / config escape hatch**
  (`ci_check_live_feed_memory_bounds.sh` guard 3): (1) GREEN `ade_network::session::core`
  `MAX_REASSEMBLY_TAIL_BYTES = 16 MiB` — after `drain_protocol_items` drains every COMPLETE item, an incomplete
  per-mini-protocol reassembly tail over the cap returns the additive closed `SessionError::ReassemblyBufferOverflow`
  and `mux_pump::session_err_to_halt` drops the peer (no silent truncation, no partial decode); (2) RED
  `ade_node::node_sync` `MAX_WIRE_PUMP_LOOKAHEAD = 256` — `pump_lookahead` stops the opportunistic drain at the
  cap so the bounded `mpsc` (`LIVE_WIRE_PUMP_CHANNEL_CAP = 64`) back-pressures the pump. These are **defensive
  implementation bounds, NOT Cardano semantic parameters** — a future hardening slice may **tighten** them, but
  may NEVER disable them or set them unbounded. The claim is **NARROW**: bounded memory before authoritative
  decode/apply — **NOT** full network DoS resistance, **NOT** peer resource fairness, **NOT** BA-02 / live-evidence
  readiness (the per-connection aggregate ceiling across the ~10 independent per-protocol reassembly buffers and
  per-connection-COUNT / peer-fairness are a SEPARATE, out-of-scope surface). **NO BLUE change** (`ade_codec`
  byte-unchanged); **NO new `NodeBlockSource` / `CoordinatorEvent` variant**; the serve/forge/containment fences
  (`ci_check_node_run_loop_containment.sh` + `ci_check_served_chain_handoff_fence.sh`) are **byte-unchanged**; **no
  live-evidence / BA-02 / RO-LIVE flip or claim**. Precision (record, not overclaim): the reassembly check is
  post-extend, so a single buffer's transient peak is `cap + one <=64 KiB mux frame` (~16.06 MiB), and
  `ProtoBuffers` holds up to ~10 INDEPENDENT per-protocol buffers each capped separately (per-connection aggregate
  ~10× the single-buffer cap — still O(constant) per connection).
- **Live `--mode node` feed reuses the closed dial/pump + FILLS the closed source (N-F-G-C S1, load-bearing).**
  The live feed for the `--mode node` `On` arm is a **REUSE** of the closed `ade_runtime::admission::{dial_for_admission,
  run_admission_wire_pump}` (no reimplementation, no new wire authority) that **FILLS** the closed
  `NodeBlockSource::WirePump` arm via `from_wire_pump`. `NodeBlockSource` stays the **closed 2-variant `{WirePump,
  InMemory}`** — `from_wire_pump` is a FILL of the existing arm, **NOT a new variant, NOT a plugin point, NOT a
  source-selection trait**. The bounded `mpsc` (`LIVE_WIRE_PUMP_CHANNEL_CAP = 64`) bridges the reused pump's
  `AdmissionPeerEvent` into the source. The **durable tip advances ONLY via `run_node_sync → pump_block`** (no
  second tip-advance; `run_node_sync` is UNMODIFIED). A dial/parse failure is logged-and-dropped (C3 honest-scope)
  — never fatal / fabricated / a tip graft. `ci_check_node_run_loop_containment.sh` is **byte-unchanged**;
  `ci_check_served_chain_handoff_fence.sh` was **BROADENED in place** (owners `{node_lifecycle.rs, node_sync.rs}`;
  guard-3 allow-list — a net tightening). **No new BLUE authority, no new canonical type, no new `NodeBlockSource`
  / `CoordinatorEvent` variant.**
- **BA-02 evidence I/O is RED file I/O over the SOLE GREEN `correlate` constructor (N-F-G-C S2, load-bearing).**
  `correlate` stays the **SOLE `Ba02Manifest` constructor**. The RED `ade_node::ba02_pass::correlate_peer_log_file`
  reads the operator-captured peer-log file → `correlate`; `write_ba02_manifest` accepts **ONLY a `Ba02Manifest`**,
  so a written manifest is **always correlate-produced** from a real peer log. A missing/unreadable file fails
  closed (`io::Error`), never a synthesized acceptance. **No self-evidence acceptance source** (not `ForgeSucceeded`
  / `self_accept` / `block_received` / served-block / wire-success / `agreement_verdict` / "agreed"). **No synthetic
  manifest is committed** — `ci_check_ba02_evidence_manifest_schema.sh` is **vacuous-until-committed**, and when a
  `CE-G-C-LIVE_*.toml` is committed it verifies the closed **8-field** schema + `schema_version == 1` +
  `peer_log_file_sha256 == sha256(committed fixture)` (the no-synthetic-manifest enforcer). The versioned
  `Ba02Manifest` (`BA02_MANIFEST_SCHEMA_VERSION = 1`) is a version-GATED contract (below).
- **Self-accept→serve handoff fence (N-F-G-B S1-S3, DC-NODE-06 — ENFORCED; BROADENED N-F-G-C).** Only a BLUE
  self-accepted `AcceptedBlock` can be served on the `--mode node` spine. The typed carrier `SelfAcceptedHandoff`
  has a **private field + a SOLE constructor** `from_self_accepted(AcceptedBlock)` — there is **NO** raw-bytes /
  `ForgedBlockArtifact` / `CoordinatorEvent` / flag / verdict constructor, so a non-self-accepted artifact is
  type-unrepresentable as a handoff. The token is the ORIGINAL from BLUE `self_accept` (CN-FORGE-01), never
  re-derived from `artifact.bytes`. The relay-loop body forwards a **typed `mpsc<SelfAcceptedHandoff>` send only**;
  served-chain mutation happens in a **sibling** task via the single `ServedChainHandle::push_atomic` fed **only**
  by `into_accepted()`. **The serve ingress fence MUST hold** (`ci_check_served_chain_handoff_fence.sh`, CE-G-B-3;
  **BROADENED by N-F-G-C** — owners `{node_lifecycle.rs, node_sync.rs}`, guard-3 flipped to an allow-list: every
  node-spine `push_atomic(` fed by `into_accepted()`; no direct `served_chain_admit(`; every node-spine unbounded
  handoff channel typed `UnboundedSender<SelfAcceptedHandoff>`). `ci_check_node_run_loop_containment.sh` stays
  **byte-/semantically unchanged**. **No new BLUE authority, no new canonical type, no new `CoordinatorEvent`
  variant.**
- **`LiveConsensusInputsCanonical` 15-field fingerprint + the non-fingerprinted `protocol_params_json` carry
  (N-F-G-A S2a, load-bearing).** The bundle fingerprint is the **frozen 15-field** canonical CBOR of
  `LiveConsensusInputsCanonical` — it already commits to `protocol_params_hash`. The N-F-G-A
  `protocol_params_json: Option<String>` preimage is carried **OUTSIDE** that fingerprint: a **non-fingerprinted
  additive carry, NOT a fingerprint-schema change** — adding it does **not** alter the bundle fingerprint, the
  field count stays 15, and the canonical CBOR is byte-unchanged. `require_forge_current_pparams` re-binds the
  preimage to the fingerprinted `protocol_params_hash` via `blake2b_256` before parsing. **The preimage MUST stay
  OUTSIDE the 15-field canonical CBOR fingerprint** (`ci_check_recovered_ledger_pparams_sourced.sh`, CE-G-A-2a) —
  folding it INTO the fingerprint is a CI failure.
- **Current-protocol-parameters source has no float path (N-F-G-A S2a).** `parse_protocol_parameters_json`
  converts the oracle pparams JSON into the canonical BLUE `ProtocolParameters` using **exact integer
  arithmetic** on `serde_json::value::RawValue` strings → `ade_ledger::rational::Rational`; no `f64`, no `as
  f64`, no serde float deserialization. A literal that cannot be represented exactly fails closed
  (`ProtocolParamsParseError::InexactRational`). The recovered ledger carries the **current** parameters
  (never `ProtocolParameters::default()` / genesis-initial), installed at seed/import (CE-G-A-2a).
- **Checked clock→slot guard fails closed before-anchor (N-F-G-A S3).** `checked_millis_to_slot` returns
  `Err(SlotAlignmentError::BeforeGenesisAnchor)` for a before-anchor tick — it **MUST NOT saturate** to
  `start_slot` (the exact case the saturating `millis_to_slot` masks). No float, no wall-clock; the saturating
  `millis_to_slot` is left intact for non-forge callers. The forge `ForgeTick` derives its slot via the checked
  guard.
- **Off-epoch forge guard fails closed before leadership (N-F-G-A S4, DC-EPOCH-03).** `forge_one_from_recovered`
  calls `forge_epoch_admission` **before** `query_leader_schedule`; an off-epoch / unlocatable slot fails
  closed (`ForgeEpochAdmission::OffEpoch`) before leadership / KES signing. The candidate epoch is derived via
  the BLUE `EraSchedule::locate` (no fabricated epoch math); the node forge path drives **no**
  `NonceInput::EpochBoundary` / `CandidateFreeze` nonce promotion (cross-epoch production is a separate
  nonce-roll cluster). The off-epoch outcome routes through the existing `CoordinatorEvent::ForgeNotLeader`
  (no new event variant). (`ci_check_node_forge_single_epoch_fail_closed.sh`.)
- **Real cardano-cli config ingress on the node path (N-F-G-A S2).** The `--mode node` operator-forge ingress
  loads opcert + genesis through the REAL `parse_opcert_envelope` + `parse_shelley_genesis`; the `parse_simple_*`
  stubs are RETIRED on the node forge path (`ci_check_node_forge_real_cli_ingress.sh`, CE-G-A-2). The genesis
  reuse extracts clock/KES/network constants ONLY — never a starting-state source.
- **Genesis-consistency fixture is evidence-only (N-F-G-A S1).** The committed private-net Ade-as-leader
  reference fixture (`consensus-inputs.json` + `shelley-genesis.json` + `PROVENANCE.md`) is **evidence input,
  never runtime authority** — never a production source of eta0 / stake / ASC / VRF keyhash; the in-test
  sidecar pre-seed is `#[cfg(test)]`-confined. The fixture must be committed + well-formed + Ade-as-leader and
  carry NO secret key material (`ci_check_genesis_consistency_fixture_present.sh`, CE-G-A-1).
- **Operator-key ingress contract (N-F-F, CE-not-law)** — `--mode node` operator-material ingress is the SINGLE
  named `operator_forge` site reusing the existing loaders; key custody RED-confined to `ProducerShell`
  (`OperatorForgeMaterial` not `Debug`/`Serialize`); the forge-on flip is opt-in over flag presence
  (`ci_check_forge_intent_closed.sh` + `ci_check_operator_forge_no_secret_leak.sh`, CN-NODE-03).
- **`--mode` taxonomy** — the 5-variant closed `Mode` set with a wildcard-free `main.rs` dispatch arm per variant
  (`ci_check_node_mode_closure.sh`, CN-NODE-MODE-01). N-F-G-C added NO `Mode` variant (the `--peer` flag is
  OPTIONAL ingress on the existing `--mode node` arm).
- **Single `bootstrap_initial_state` authority** — all initial state (produce cold-start, Conway genesis, the
  Mithril provenance + production-bootstrap paths, the N-F-A warm-start restore, both N-F-C lifecycle arms)
  routes through this one chokepoint; no `*Anchor` trait/plugin seam (CN-NODE-01 / CN-MITHRIL-01). N-F-G-C's live
  feed introduces no second bootstrap.
- **`SeedEpochConsensusInputs` SOLE codec** — the A1 version-gated, byte-canonical, `BTreeMap`-ordered
  encoder/decoder; `SEED_CINPUT_SCHEMA_VERSION = 1`; no `Default` / `#[non_exhaustive]` (CN-CINPUT-01).
- **tag-24 wire envelope** — the single `ade_codec::cbor::tag24::{wrap_tag24, unwrap_tag24}` authority; the
  BlockFetch (storage Conway = 7) vs ChainSync (consensus Conway = 6) era-index schemes are pinned byte-identically
  against cardano-node 11.0.1 (CN-WIRE-08). N-F-G-C's live feed reuses `admission::runner`'s tag-24 unwrap verbatim.
- **block-envelope grammar** — the single `encode_block_envelope` / `decode_block_envelope` pair, storage-form
  `[era, block]`, Conway discriminant 7 (CN-FORGE-03).
- **era→leader-VRF-input construction** — the single `leader_vrf_input` authority per era/protocol; the Praos
  producer alpha equals the validator alpha (CN-FORGE-04).
- **Sum6KES algorithm + 608-byte cardano-cli skey envelope** — byte-identical to Haskell `cardano-base`;
  `raw_deserialize_signing_key_kes` is the structural validator (DC-CRYPTO-04..09).
- **Wire format / encoding**: `postcard` / CBOR per the pinned manifest versions; field order = wire order where
  applicable. **All 456 canonical types**: existing wire formats frozen; new types may be added behind a version
  gate. **Hash algorithms**: `blake2b_256` / `blake2b_224` — algorithm immutable per version.

### Version-gated (can evolve across major versions)

- New variants in the closed message / event / classifier taxonomies (`Mode`, `LoopStep`, `CoordinatorEvent`,
  `SeedProvenance`, `SyncEffect`, `ExpectedVrfInput`, `BA02Outcome`, `PeerAcceptEvent`, …) — each requires a new
  envelope/schema version + a wildcard-free dispatch arm + a registry-rule strengthening.
- The `Ba02Manifest` schema (`BA02_MANIFEST_SCHEMA_VERSION = 1`) — additions bump the schema version; the N-F-G-C
  `CE-G-C-LIVE_*.toml` operator-pass manifest schema (8 closed keys) evolves with it (RO-LIVE-06 /
  CN-OPERATOR-EVIDENCE-01).
- The redb `chaindb` `SCHEMA_VERSION` (currently **v3**, anchor-fp-keyed seed-epoch sidecar namespace) — a
  versioned gate, not a frozen contract (N-F-A).
- The `ANCHOR_SCHEMA_VERSION = 2` (`SeedProvenance`) + the `SEED_CINPUT_SCHEMA_VERSION = 1` decoders — version-gated.
- Canonical type schema additions (new fields appended; sort/dedup + `BTreeMap` ordering invariants preserved).
- `WalEntry` wire tags (append-only: `AdmitBlock` = 0, `SeedEpochConsensusInputsImported` = 3; 1/2 reserved) — a
  CE-not-law additively-evolvable surface.
- The N-F-G-E memory bounds (`MAX_REASSEMBLY_TAIL_BYTES = 16 MiB`, `MAX_WIRE_PUMP_LOOKAHEAD = 256`) — closed
  literal constants that a future hardening slice may **tighten** (a strengthening of DC-LIVEMEM-01), but may
  NEVER make tunable / unbounded; they carry **no CLI / env / config override** at any version
  (`ci_check_live_feed_memory_bounds.sh` guard 3).
- New CI checks (existing checks may be **tightened, never relaxed** — e.g. N-F-G-C BROADENED
  `ci_check_served_chain_handoff_fence.sh` in place, a net tightening; N-F-G-E added
  `ci_check_live_feed_memory_bounds.sh`).

## 5. Module Addition Rules

How new modules enter the workspace.

| Color | Naming convention | Build-config flags | May depend on | MUST NOT depend on |
|-------|-------------------|--------------------|----------------|--------------------|
| **BLUE** | `ade_*` crate, or a BLUE `ade_network` submodule path in `.idd-config.json` `core_paths`; `// Core Contract:` + `//! BLUE …` banner first line | `#![deny(unsafe_code)]`, `deny(unwrap_used / expect_used / panic / float_arithmetic)`; no `#[cfg(feature = …)]` semantic gating | Other BLUE modules only (`ade_types` ← `ade_codec`/`ade_crypto` ← `ade_core` ← `ade_ledger`/`ade_plutus`; `ade_network` BLUE submodules ← `ade_codec`+`ade_types`) | `ade_runtime`, `ade_node`, `ade_core_interop`, the RED half of `ade_network`; std runtime / I/O / clock / rand / `HashMap` / float / async |
| **GREEN** | `ade_testkit` crate, `ade_network::session`, or a GREEN-by-content sub-tree inside `ade_runtime` / `ade_node` (incl. `forward_sync::reducer`, `seed_consensus_merge` (N-F-A), `consensus_inputs::protocol_params` + `consensus_inputs::canonical::require_forge_current_pparams` (N-F-G-A), `clock::checked_millis_to_slot` (N-F-G-A), `ba02_evidence` (N-F-C), `producer::self_accepted_handoff` (N-F-G-B), `run_loop_planner` (N-F-D/N-F-E), `forge_intent` (N-F-F), `node_sync::forge_epoch_admission` (N-F-G-A, GREEN-by-fn), `harness::sync_diff`, `consensus::genesis_pinning` (N-F-G-A, `#[cfg(test)]`)) with a `//! GREEN …` / `// GREEN` banner | Same deny attributes as BLUE; a purity CI gate per sub-tree (`run_loop_planner`: `ci_check_loop_planner_closed.sh`; `forge_intent`: `ci_check_forge_intent_closed.sh`; `protocol_params` + `require_forge_current_pparams`: `ci_check_recovered_ledger_pparams_sourced.sh`; `forge_epoch_admission`: `ci_check_node_forge_single_epoch_fail_closed.sh`; `self_accepted_handoff`: `ci_check_served_chain_handoff_fence.sh`; `genesis_pinning`: `ci_check_genesis_consistency_fixture_present.sh`) | BLUE modules | RED modules in non-test deps; nondeterminism; secret material; float; participation in authoritative outputs |
| **RED** | `ade_runtime`, `ade_node`, `ade_core_interop`, `ade_network::mux::transport` (incl. `forward_sync::pump`, `mithril_import`, `genesis_bootstrap`, `mithril_bootstrap` (N-Z), `seed_consensus_provenance` (N-F-A), `recovery::restart`, `node_lifecycle` (incl. `run_relay_loop` + `ForgeActivation` + `spawn_live_wire_pump_source`, N-F-D/N-F-E/N-F-G-A/N-F-G-C), `node_sync` (N-F-C), `ba02_pass` (N-F-G-C, the operator-pass BA-02 evidence I/O), `operator_forge` (N-F-F; N-F-G-A real parsers), `admission::{seed_to_snapshot, bootstrap}` (N-F-G-A current-pparams install; N-F-G-C `build_n2n_version_table` `pub(crate)`); `*_mode.rs` for mode handlers); `//! RED …` banner | tokio/std/I/O allowed; the `Clock` seam is the SOLE wall-clock observation reachable from a relay-loop/orchestrator driver (N-F-G-A: the forge path uses the checked `checked_millis_to_slot`); key custody confined to `ProducerShell` | Any module | — (RED is the leaf) |

### New module checklist

1. Add to `Cargo.toml` `[workspace] members` (BLUE submodule paths: also add to `.idd-config.json`
   `core_paths`).
2. Apply the `// Core Contract:` + `//! BLUE|GREEN|RED` banner first line (`ci_check_module_headers.sh`).
3. BLUE/GREEN: inherit the deny attributes; pass `ci_check_forbidden_patterns.sh`,
   `ci_check_no_async_in_blue.sh`, `ci_check_no_semantic_cfg.sh`.
4. `ci_check_dependency_boundary.sh` rejects forbidden cross-color imports; `ci_check_pallas_quarantine.sh`
   confines `pallas-*` to `ade_plutus`.
5. New canonical types: add round-trip tests (`canonical_type_registry: null`; canonical-type rules live
   inline in registry family T).
6. New closed surface: add a `[[rules]]` entry + a CI gate; reference it by ID in the docs.
7. **New seed source: route through `bootstrap_initial_state` — NO `*Anchor` trait/plugin seam**
   (`ci_check_mithril_uses_bootstrap_initial_state.sh`). **A production-bootstrap composition attaches as a
   composition-only RED twin of `bootstrap_from_{conway_genesis, mithril_snapshot}`: verify-before-bootstrap,
   fail-closed, operator-independent `seed_point` origin** (`ci_check_mithril_seed_point_independence.sh`),
   **and (N-F-A) a sidecar tail that WRITES — never consumes — the recovered seed-epoch surface, populate-side
   only** (`ci_check_consensus_input_provenance.sh` — CN-CINPUT-02).
8. **New recovered/canonical record with a SOLE codec (like N-F-A):** put the type + its encoder/decoder in a
   single BLUE module; version-gate the decoder; keep it `BTreeMap`-ordered, byte-canonical, no `Default` /
   `#[non_exhaustive]` (CN-CINPUT-01-style).
9. **If a rule cites a moved/renamed source path: update its `code_locus`** —
   `ci_check_registry_code_locus_exists.sh` fails closed on any cited `crates/**.rs` / `ci/**.sh` path that
   does not exist on disk.
10. **New `--mode` (N-F-C rule):** (i) add the variant to the CLOSED `Mode` enum (not `#[non_exhaustive]`);
    (ii) add a `Mode::parse` arm + a wildcard-free `main.rs` arm (`ci_check_node_mode_closure.sh`); (iii) if it
    needs initial state, obtain it via the SINGLE `bootstrap_initial_state` authority (CN-NODE-01); (iv) if it
    forges, obtain consensus inputs ONLY via the recovered `SeedEpochConsensusInputs` →
    `PoolDistrView::from_seed_epoch_consensus_inputs` surface (CN-CINPUT-03 / DC-CINPUT-02b).
11. **New live-run step (N-F-D / N-F-E rule):** (i) add the variant to the closed GREEN `LoopStep` enum + a
    content-blind planner input + a total `plan_loop_step` arm — the planner observes a `SlotNo` ONLY in a
    dedicated pure guard (`ci_check_loop_planner_closed.sh`); (ii) add a fenced RED `run_relay_loop` branch
    that advances the tip ONLY via `run_node_sync` and (if it forges) reaches EXACTLY ONE
    `forge_one_from_recovered`, serving/admitting/gossiping nothing (`ci_check_node_run_loop_containment.sh`);
    (iii) take any wall-clock observation ONLY through the RED `Clock` seam (DC-NODE-03); (iv) make the step
    opt-in via a closed activation struct (`ForgeActivation`-style) — `None` MUST reproduce the prior relay
    behavior.
12. **New operator-material ingress (N-F-F rule):** (i) classify the *decision* as a PURE GREEN function of CLI
    flag PRESENCE over a closed enum, binding every combination by name, the error carrying only static
    flag-name strings (`ci_check_forge_intent_closed.sh`); (ii) ingest the material at a SINGLE named RED site
    that REUSES the existing loaders (no reimpl) in a RED-parse → BLUE-structural-validate → canonical-type
    pipeline — NO new BLUE authority, NO plugin/trait seam, NO second forge/bootstrap codepath; (iii) confine
    key custody to `ProducerShell` — the holder struct is NOT `Debug`/`Serialize`
    (`ci_check_operator_forge_no_secret_leak.sh`); (iv) derive any identity in ONE named place; (v) make
    activation opt-in over flag presence; (vi) reuse the SAME single recovered `BootstrapState` (CN-NODE-01);
    (vii) leave the prior forge-containment gate SEMANTICALLY UNCHANGED. CN-NODE-03.
13. **New forge-fidelity / fail-closed boundary (N-F-G-A rule):** (i) if it sources a forge constant from an
    oracle preimage, parse it at a single GREEN site with a closed error vocabulary, **no float path** (exact
    `Rational` or fail closed), and carry the preimage **OUTSIDE** the frozen bundle fingerprint, hash-binding
    it to a value the fingerprint already commits to (`ci_check_recovered_ledger_pparams_sourced.sh`); (ii)
    install the sourced constant at seed/import — **never a `::default()`** (CE-G-A-2a); (iii) if it ingests
    operator config, use the REAL parsers (`ci_check_node_forge_real_cli_ingress.sh`); (iv) if it is a
    fail-closed boundary on the forge path, make it an *error* (never a saturation or a third variant) and place
    it INSIDE the existing forge fence; (v) derive any epoch/era decision via the BLUE `EraSchedule::locate` and
    drive NO nonce promotion (DC-EPOCH-03, `ci_check_node_forge_single_epoch_fail_closed.sh`); (vi) any committed
    reference fixture is **evidence-only** (`ci_check_genesis_consistency_fixture_present.sh`).
14. **New self-accept→serve handoff (N-F-G-B rule):** (i) move a forged block to the serve task ONLY through a
    GREEN constructor-fenced carrier whose SOLE constructor takes a BLUE self-accepted `AcceptedBlock` (no
    raw-bytes / artifact / event / flag / verdict ctor); (ii) surface the ORIGINAL BLUE token (never re-derived
    from `artifact.bytes`, CN-FORGE-01); (iii) the relay-loop body forwards a TYPED channel send ONLY — no
    `ServedChainHandle` / `push_atomic` / `served_chain_admit` in the loop body; (iv) served-chain mutation lives
    in a sibling task via the single `push_atomic` fed ONLY by `into_accepted()`; (v) the handoff channel is typed
    `UnboundedSender<SelfAcceptedHandoff>` (never raw bytes / artifact / flag). DC-NODE-06 /
    `ci_check_served_chain_handoff_fence.sh`.
15. **New live `--mode node` feed (N-F-G-C rule):** (i) REUSE the closed `ade_runtime::admission::{dial_for_admission,
    run_admission_wire_pump}` VERBATIM (no reimpl, no new wire authority); (ii) FILL the closed
    `NodeBlockSource::WirePump` arm via `from_wire_pump` — NEVER add a `NodeBlockSource` variant / plugin point /
    source-selection trait; (iii) bridge via a BOUNDED `mpsc`; (iv) advance the durable tip ONLY via `run_node_sync
    → pump_block` (no second tip-advance; `run_node_sync` UNMODIFIED); (v) log-and-drop a dial/parse failure (never
    fatal / fabricated / a tip graft); (vi) leave `ci_check_node_run_loop_containment.sh` byte-unchanged. The
    served-chain handoff fence (`ci_check_served_chain_handoff_fence.sh`) may be BROADENED (net tightening), never
    relaxed.
16. **New operator-pass evidence I/O (N-F-G-C rule):** (i) it is RED file I/O over the UNCHANGED GREEN `correlate`
    — `correlate` stays the SOLE `Ba02Manifest` constructor; (ii) a manifest-writer accepts ONLY a `Ba02Manifest`
    (no path emitting one from `NoEvidence` / raw operator input); (iii) a missing/unreadable file fails closed
    (`io::Error`), never a synthesized acceptance; (iv) NO self-evidence acceptance source; (v) NO committed
    synthetic manifest — a committed-manifest schema gate is vacuous-until-committed + sha256-binds its fixture
    (`ci_check_ba02_evidence_manifest_schema.sh`, RO-LIVE-06 / CN-OPERATOR-EVIDENCE-01).
17. **New peer-driven memory bound (N-F-G-E rule):** (i) bound the surface with a **CLOSED LITERAL constant** —
    NEVER a tunable wired to CLI / env / config (`ci_check_live_feed_memory_bounds.sh` guard 3; a future slice may
    only *tighten* it); (ii) the over-cap behavior MUST **fail closed** — drop-and-disconnect for an inbound
    surface (the reassembly cap → the additive closed `SessionError::ReassemblyBufferOverflow` → drop the peer) or
    back-pressure an existing bounded channel (the lookahead cap → the bounded `mpsc`) — NEVER a silent truncation,
    partial decode, fabricated block, or tip graft; (iii) place the bound **BEFORE** the BLUE `ade_codec` decode
    path / before any authoritative apply; (iv) if it signals via a closed enum, extend it **additively** with NO
    wildcard and handle the new variant in every exhaustive consumer; (v) leave the verdict-decoupled
    `NodeBlockSource` contract, the relay-loop containment gate, and the served-chain handoff fence
    byte-unchanged. DC-LIVEMEM-01.

### CI gates that enforce the boundary (119 total; the N-F-G-E / N-F-G-C / N-F-G-B / N-F-G-A / N-F-F / N-F-D-E / N-F-C / N-F-A / N-Z / N-Y / producer / network set)

| Script | Enforces | Cluster |
|---|---|---|
| `ci_check_live_feed_memory_bounds.sh` *(NEW N-F-G-E S1)* | **DC-LIVEMEM-01** — both live-feed memory bounds are CLOSED LITERAL constants (`MAX_REASSEMBLY_TAIL_BYTES = 16 MiB` in `session/core.rs`; `MAX_WIRE_PUMP_LOOKAHEAD = 256` in `node_sync.rs`) AND not wired to CLI / env / config (the no-escape-hatch guard 3; line comments stripped first so the doc-comments naming "CLI / env / config" do not self-trip). The reassembly cap fails closed via the additive `SessionError::ReassemblyBufferOverflow` (no wildcard; sole consumer `mux_pump::session_err_to_halt`). | N-F-G-E |
| `ci_check_ba02_evidence_manifest_schema.sh` *(NEW N-F-G-C S2)* | **RO-LIVE-06 / CN-OPERATOR-EVIDENCE-01 (BA-02 manifest schema)** — when a committed `docs/clusters/PHASE4-N-F-G-C/CE-G-C-LIVE_*.toml` is present, verify the closed 8-field schema + `schema_version == 1` + `peer_log_file_sha256` == sha256(the committed peer-log fixture). Vacuously satisfied when none committed. The no-synthetic-manifest enforcer. | N-F-G-C |
| `ci_check_served_chain_handoff_fence.sh` *(N-F-G-B S3; BROADENED in place N-F-G-C S1)* | **DC-NODE-06 / CN-PROD-04 (serve-ingress fence)** — owners `{node_lifecycle.rs, node_sync.rs}`; (1) every node-spine `push_atomic(` fed by `into_accepted()`; (2) no direct `served_chain_admit(` on the node spine; (3) ALLOW-LIST: every node-spine unbounded handoff channel carries `SelfAcceptedHandoff` (never `<Vec<u8>>` / `<ForgedBlockArtifact>` / `<bool>`), and at least one `UnboundedSender<SelfAcceptedHandoff>` is present. A net tightening; the CI count does NOT change for this file. | N-F-G-B / N-F-G-C |
| `ci_check_genesis_consistency_fixture_present.sh` *(N-F-G-A S1)* | **CE-G-A-1** — the three S1b fixture files committed + well-formed + Ade-as-leader; NO secret key material. | N-F-G-A |
| `ci_check_recovered_ledger_pparams_sourced.sh` *(N-F-G-A S2a)* | **CE-G-A-2a** — recovered ledger `protocol_params` sourced from the oracle preimage (`require_forge_current_pparams`), never `::default()`; the `protocol_params_json` preimage OUTSIDE the 15-field fingerprint. | N-F-G-A |
| `ci_check_node_forge_real_cli_ingress.sh` *(N-F-G-A S2)* | **CE-G-A-2** — the `--mode node` operator-forge ingress uses the real `parse_opcert_envelope` + `parse_shelley_genesis`; fails closed on a `parse_simple_*` reintroduction. | N-F-G-A |
| `ci_check_node_forge_single_epoch_fail_closed.sh` *(N-F-G-A S4)* | **DC-EPOCH-03 / CE-G-A-4** — `forge_one_from_recovered` calls `forge_epoch_admission` BEFORE `query_leader_schedule`; candidate epoch via `EraSchedule::locate`; NO nonce promotion. | N-F-G-A |
| `ci_check_forge_intent_closed.sh` *(N-F-F)* | **CN-NODE-03 (intent half)** — closed two-variant `ForgeIntent`; `classify_forge_intent` sole entry; partial arm binds by name; `ForgeIntentError` static flag-name strings only. | N-F-F |
| `ci_check_operator_forge_no_secret_leak.sh` *(N-F-F; reuse scope extended N-F-G-A)* | **CN-NODE-03 (custody half) / OP-OPS-04** — `operator_forge` reuses the existing loaders (incl. N-F-G-A real parsers); `OperatorForgeMaterial` not `Debug`/`Serialize`; no private-key byte accessor / serialization / logging. | N-F-F |
| `ci_check_node_binary_uses_single_bootstrap.sh` *(MODIFIED-in-place N-F-F)* | **CN-NODE-01** — `ReceiveState::new` owner allow-list `{node.rs, node_lifecycle.rs}`. | N-F-F |
| `ci_check_loop_planner_closed.sh` *(N-F-D; EXTENDED N-F-E; UNCHANGED N-F-G-A/N-F-G-C)* | **CN-NODE-02 / DC-NODE-05** — the GREEN `run_loop_planner` emits only the closed `LoopStep` set, content-blind; the `SlotNo` ban scoped to `plan_loop_step`; `ForgeTick`/`ForgeSlotStatus` pinned. | N-F-D / N-F-E |
| `ci_check_node_run_loop_containment.sh` *(N-F-D; TIGHTENED N-F-E; UNCHANGED N-F-F/N-F-G-A/N-F-G-B/N-F-G-C)* | **CN-NODE-02 / DC-SYNC-02 / DC-NODE-05** — the relay-loop body advances the tip ONLY via `run_node_sync`; references NO `run_real_forge` / `correlate(` / `Ba02Manifest` / second-bootstrap path; **exactly one** fenced `forge_one_from_recovered` (CE-E-4) with the no-serve tokens forbidden. N-F-F/N-F-G-A/N-F-G-B/N-F-G-C left it byte-/semantically unchanged. | N-F-D / N-F-E |
| `ci_check_lifecycle_owner_uses_bootstrap_initial_state.sh` *(N-F-C)* | **CN-NODE-01** — exactly one `PHASE4-N-F-C-LIFECYCLE-OWNER`; FirstRun via `bootstrap_from_mithril_snapshot(` + WarmStart via `bootstrap_initial_state(RequiredFromRecoveredProvenance)`; no parallel/cold init, no fallback, no `recover_node_state(` overclaim. | N-F-C |
| `ci_check_node_sync_via_pump.sh` *(N-F-C)* | **DC-SYNC-01 (driver containment)** — `run_node_sync` advances the tip ONLY via `pump_block(`. (L5 `forge_one_from_recovered` excluded.) | N-F-C |
| `ci_check_ba02_evidence_closed.sh` *(N-F-C; reuse scope incl. `ba02_pass` N-F-G-C)* | **RO-LIVE-06 (BA-02 honesty)** — exactly one `Ba02Manifest` constructor (inside `correlate`); no self-evidence token as an acceptance source; no committed `docs/evidence/*ba02*` manifest. The N-F-G-C `ba02_pass` file I/O is consumed over this UNCHANGED correlator. | N-F-C |
| `ci_check_node_mode_closure.sh` *(N-F-C / N-Q)* | **CN-NODE-MODE-01** — pins the full 5-variant closed `Mode` set with a wildcard-free `main.rs` arm per variant. | N-F-C / N-Q |
| `ci_check_consensus_input_provenance.sh` *(N-F-A; guard (d) N-F-C)* | **CN-CINPUT-02 (populate)** + **CN-CINPUT-03 / DC-CINPUT-02b (consume, guard (d))**. | N-F-A / N-F-C |
| `ci_check_mithril_seed_point_independence.sh` *(N-Z)* | **DC-MITHRIL-02 + CN-MITHRIL-01** — `verify_mithril_binding(` precedes `bootstrap_initial_state(`; the `MintInputs` seed-point RHS never traces to a manifest-origin token. | N-Z |
| `ci_check_forward_sync_chokepoint_only.sh` *(N-Y)* | DC-SYNC-01 — durable-before-tip; `AdmitPlan` is the sole `AdvanceTip` emitter. | N-Y |
| `ci_check_mithril_uses_bootstrap_initial_state.sh` *(N-Y)* | CN-MITHRIL-01 — the Mithril path routes initial state through the single authority; no `*Anchor` trait/plugin seam. | N-Y |
| `ci_check_no_haskell_fingerprint_equality.sh` *(N-Y; scope incl. `genesis_pinning` N-F-G-A)* | DC-COMPAT-01 — the harness compares observable surfaces only, never an internal-ledger-fingerprint-vs-Haskell-hash equality. | N-Y |
| `ci_check_sync_evidence_manifest_schema.sh` *(N-Y)* | RO-SYNC-EVIDENCE-01 — closed sync-evidence manifest schema. | N-Y |
| `ci_check_recovery_contract.sh` *(strengthened N-Y)* | recovery-contract / DC-WAL-* — recovery composes existing authorities; fail-fast on `WalTailFingerprintMismatch`. | N-Y |
| `ci_check_registry_code_locus_exists.sh` *(`5db9aae`, extended `a2af041`)* | Registry↔source coherence — every cited `crates/**.rs` + `ci/**.sh` path must exist on disk. | post-N-Y |
| `ci_check_clock_seam.sh`, `ci_check_orchestrator_core_purity.sh` *(N-K; strengthened N-F-E)* | DC-NODE-03 — `clock.rs` is the SOLE `SystemTime::now()`/`Instant::now()` site in `ade_runtime`; the orchestrator/relay-loop core observes no clock/rand/`HashMap`/float — only a `SlotNo` crosses. (The N-F-G-A `checked_millis_to_slot` is pure, no float, no wall-clock.) | N-K / N-F-E |
| `ci_check_tag24_wire_authority.sh` | CN-WIRE-08 — single tag-24 wrap/unwrap authority. | N-X |
| `ci_check_producer_praos_vrf.sh` | CN-FORGE-04 — single era→leader-VRF-input authority. | N-W |
| `ci_check_leader_check_authority.sh` | CN-FORGE-02 — BLUE leader-check has no LedgerView/RED dep. | N-R-A |
| `ci_check_unsigned_header_preimage_single_source.sh` | CN-KES-HEADER-01 / DC-KES-HEADER-01 — single pre-image recipe. | N-S-A |
| `ci_check_no_produce_mode_direct_transport_writes.sh` | CN-OUTBOUND-RELAY-01 — bytes only via `OutboundCommand` → `MuxPump`. | N-S-B |
| `ci_check_operator_evidence_manifest_schema.sh` | CN-OPERATOR-EVIDENCE-01 — closed evidence-manifest TOML schema. | N-S-C |
| `ci_check_produce_mode_uses_bootstrap_initial_state.sh` | CN-PROD-03 / N-T — `produce_mode` obtains initial state only via `bootstrap_initial_state`. | N-T |
| `ci_check_forge_decode_round_trip.sh`, `ci_check_no_independent_forge_codepath.sh` | CN-FORGE-03 — single forge codepath. | N-V |
| `ci_check_producer_coordinator_no_secrets.sh` | CN-PROD-02 — GREEN coordinator holds no secrets. | N-Q |

## 6. Forbidden Patterns (per color)

- **BLUE:** no clock, rand, raw `HashMap`/`HashSet`/`IndexMap`, float, env access, network/filesystem, async
  runtime, locale-dependent ops, OS-dependent ordering. No signing (`ci_check_no_signing_in_blue.sh`). No
  `#[cfg(feature = …)]` semantic gating. No `PreservedCbor` construction outside `ade_codec`. No re-encode of
  wire bytes when hashing. No second era→leader-VRF-input construction (CN-FORGE-04). No second `wrap_tag24` /
  `unwrap_tag24` definition (CN-WIRE-08). No second bootstrap/storage-init authority (CN-NODE-01 /
  DC-GENESIS-SRC-01); no tautological Mithril binding check (CN-MITHRIL-01); `genesis_initial_state` is
  Conway-only. **(N-F-A) No second `SeedEpochConsensusInputs` encoder/decoder pair (CN-CINPUT-01 — SOLE codec);
  `decode_*` MUST be version-gated, byte-canonical, `BTreeMap`-ordered with no `Default` / `#[non_exhaustive]`.
  `PoolDistrView::from_seed_epoch_consensus_inputs` MUST be a pure field-map.** **(N-F-F / N-F-G-A / N-F-G-B /
  N-F-G-C) No BLUE crate was modified — operator-key ingress + forge fidelity + the self-accept→serve handoff +
  the live feed + the BA-02 evidence I/O reuse the existing BLUE validators/authorities
  (`Sum6Kes::raw_deserialize_signing_key_kes`, `ProducerShell::init`'s freshness bound, the `ProtocolParameters`
  model, exact `Rational` arithmetic, `EraSchedule::locate`, `served_chain_admit`, the BLUE-minted forged hash)
  verbatim; no new BLUE authority. `ade_ledger::rational::Rational` MUST stay exact-integer (no float arithmetic).**
- **GREEN:** no nondeterminism; no participation in authoritative outputs. The `producer::coordinator` MUST NOT
  own/store private signing material; **its closed 9-variant `CoordinatorEvent` MUST stay additively stable —
  the N-F-G-A off-epoch outcome reuses `ForgeNotLeader`, the N-F-G-B token rides a sibling return component, and
  N-F-G-C adds no variant.** `ChainEvolution` (N-T) MUST NEVER mint `AcceptedBlock`. Closed vocabularies
  (`ProducerLogEvent`, `ForgeFailureReason`, `SyncEffect`, observable `BlockVerdict`, `LoopStep` /
  `ForgeSlotStatus`, `ForgeIntent`, `SlotAlignmentError` / `ProtocolParamsParseError` / `ForgeCurrentPParamsError`
  / `ForgeEpochAdmission`, the BA-02 `BA02Outcome` / `PeerAcceptEvent` / `NoEvidenceReason`) — no open/wildcard
  variant. `forward_sync::reducer` (DC-SYNC-01): MUST NOT emit `AdvanceTip` before that block's `StoreBlockBytes`
  + `AppendWal`. **(N-F-A) `seed_consensus_merge` MUST fail closed on a pool in exactly one source map — NEVER a
  zero-hash fill.** **(N-F-C / N-F-G-C) `ba02_evidence` is evidence, not authority — it COMPARES already-authoritative
  outputs, MUST read the BLUE-minted forged hash VERBATIM, `correlate` MUST be the SOLE `Ba02Manifest`
  constructor; NO self-evidence acceptance source; NO committed synthetic manifest (RO-LIVE-06). N-F-G-C added the
  RED `ba02_pass` file-I/O wrapper over this UNCHANGED correlator — it constructs no evidence and `write_ba02_manifest`
  accepts ONLY a `Ba02Manifest`.** **(N-F-G-B) `producer::self_accepted_handoff::SelfAcceptedHandoff` MUST have a
  PRIVATE field + a SOLE constructor taking a BLUE `AcceptedBlock` — NO raw-bytes / `ForgedBlockArtifact` /
  `CoordinatorEvent` / flag / verdict constructor; it MUST carry the ORIGINAL token verbatim, never re-validating
  or re-deriving it (CN-FORGE-01 / DC-NODE-06).** **(N-F-D / N-F-E) `run_loop_planner` MUST observe a `SlotNo` ONLY
  in the dedicated `forge_slot_status` guard, emit only the closed `LoopStep` set, decide no authority.** **(N-F-F)
  `forge_intent` MUST observe only flag PRESENCE, emit only the closed 2-variant `ForgeIntent`, bind the partial
  arm by name (CN-NODE-03).** **(N-F-G-E) `ade_network::session::core` MUST fail closed on a reassembly tail over
  `MAX_REASSEMBLY_TAIL_BYTES` via the additive closed `SessionError::ReassemblyBufferOverflow` (NO wildcard; the
  bound fires BEFORE the BLUE decode path — no silent truncation, no partial decode); the cap MUST be a closed
  literal constant with NO CLI / env / config escape hatch (DC-LIVEMEM-01).** **(N-F-G-A) `consensus_inputs::protocol_params` MUST have NO float path; `require_forge_current_pparams`
  MUST keep the `protocol_params_json` preimage OUTSIDE the 15-field fingerprint + hash-bind before parsing;
  `checked_millis_to_slot` MUST fail closed before-anchor (never saturate); `forge_epoch_admission` MUST derive
  via `EraSchedule::locate` + drive no nonce promotion; `consensus::genesis_pinning` is `#[cfg(test)]` evidence,
  never runtime authority (DC-COMPAT-01).** `harness::sync_diff` (DC-COMPAT-01): MUST NOT compare Ade's internal
  ledger `fingerprint` to a Haskell hash. `lagging` ≠ success; wire success ≠ admission ≠ agreement ≠ peer ACCEPT.
- **RED:** no direct mutation of BLUE state; no construction of semantic types from raw bytes; no bypassing
  canonical validation. `produce_mode` emits outbound bytes only via `OutboundCommand`. The per-peer outbound
  map is `BTreeMap` (deterministic). Key custody confined to `producer::signing` / `producer_shell`.
  `run_real_forge` (N-W) MUST NOT perform RED-side era dispatch for the leader-VRF alpha. No hand-rolled tag-24
  parse (CN-WIRE-08). `forward_sync::pump` (DC-SYNC-01) MUST refuse to advance the tip before the durability
  writes ack. `mithril_import` MUST perform no semantic decision and route initial state through the single
  `bootstrap_initial_state` authority (CN-MITHRIL-01). `genesis_bootstrap` / `mithril_bootstrap` MUST route
  through the same authority — never a parallel storage-init path (CN-NODE-01 / DC-GENESIS-SRC-01); **(N-Z)**
  mint the anchor `seed_point` from the operator-independent `MithrilSeedPointInputs` ONLY, and run
  `verify_mithril_binding` fail-closed BEFORE `bootstrap_initial_state` (DC-MITHRIL-02). `recovery::restart`
  MUST compose the existing WAL-replay + rollback authorities and fail fast on `WalTailFingerprintMismatch`.
  **(N-F-A) `seed_consensus_provenance::append_seed_epoch_provenance` MUST `blake2b_256` the EXACT A1 bytes the
  composer `put`, only AFTER the durable sidecar put. `bootstrap::restore_seed_epoch_consensus_inputs` MUST fail
  closed on a missing sidecar / hash mismatch / non-canonical decode / binding mismatch / non-byte-identical
  re-encode, and MUST NOT fall back to the forge-time bundle. `produce_mode` MUST pass
  `SeedEpochConsensusSource::NotRequired` (CN-CINPUT-02).** **(N-F-C) `Mode` MUST stay closed with a wildcard-free
  `main.rs` arm per variant (CN-NODE-MODE-01). Exactly one `--mode node` lifecycle owner; both arms route through
  the SINGLE `bootstrap_initial_state` authority (CN-NODE-01). `NodeBlockSource` MUST yield ordered block bytes and
  NOTHING else; `run_node_sync` MUST advance the tip ONLY via `pump_block`. `node_sync::forge_one_from_recovered`
  MUST project leadership ONLY via `PoolDistrView::from_seed_epoch_consensus_inputs` (CN-CINPUT-03 /
  DC-CINPUT-02b).** **(N-F-D/E) Exactly one live-run owner; the relay-loop body MUST advance the tip ONLY via
  `run_node_sync`, reach EXACTLY ONE fenced `forge_one_from_recovered` per `ForgeTick`, advance NO durable tip,
  serve/admit/gossip NOTHING (CN-NODE-02 / DC-SYNC-02 / DC-NODE-05).** **(N-F-F) Operator-material ingress MUST
  land at the SINGLE named `operator_forge` site reusing the existing loaders — NO new BLUE authority, NO plugin
  seam, NO second forge codepath, NO Mithril call, NO second bootstrap; key custody RED-confined to
  `ProducerShell`; the forge-on flip opt-in over flag presence (CN-NODE-03).** **(N-F-G-A) The `--mode node`
  ingress MUST use the REAL parsers; recovered pparams MUST be sourced from the oracle preimage (never
  `::default()`); the forge tick MUST use `checked_millis_to_slot` + `forge_epoch_admission` BEFORE leadership;
  NO nonce promotion (DC-EPOCH-03). The N-F-E forge containment MUST stay SEMANTICALLY UNCHANGED.** **(N-F-G-B)
  The self-accept→serve handoff MUST move a forged block to the serve task ONLY through the constructor-fenced
  `SelfAcceptedHandoff` carrier; `run_real_forge` / `forge_one_from_recovered` MUST surface the ORIGINAL BLUE
  `AcceptedBlock` (`Some` iff `ForgeSucceeded`), never re-derived from `artifact.bytes` (CN-FORGE-01). The
  relay-loop body MUST forward a TYPED `mpsc<SelfAcceptedHandoff>` `tx.send` ONLY — no `ServedChainHandle`, no
  `push_atomic` / `served_chain_admit`, no served-chain mutation. Served-chain mutation MUST happen ONLY in the
  sibling `tokio::spawn` task via the single `ServedChainHandle::push_atomic`, fed ONLY by `into_accepted()`; the
  handoff channel MUST be typed `UnboundedSender<SelfAcceptedHandoff>` (DC-NODE-06 / CN-PROD-04,
  `ci_check_served_chain_handoff_fence.sh`).** **(N-F-G-C) The live `--mode node` feed MUST REUSE the closed
  `ade_runtime::admission::{dial_for_admission, run_admission_wire_pump}` VERBATIM (no reimpl, no new wire
  authority) and FILL the closed `NodeBlockSource::WirePump` arm via `from_wire_pump` — NEVER a new
  `NodeBlockSource` variant / plugin point / source-selection trait, NEVER a second tip-advance (`run_node_sync`
  UNMODIFIED), NEVER a dial/parse-failure that is fatal / fabricated / a tip graft (log-and-drop, C3). The bounded
  `mpsc` cap MUST stay bounded. `ci_check_node_run_loop_containment.sh` MUST stay byte-unchanged; the served-chain
  handoff fence may be BROADENED (net tightening), never relaxed. The RED `ba02_pass` MUST be file I/O ONLY over
  the UNCHANGED GREEN `correlate` — `correlate` the SOLE `Ba02Manifest` ctor; `write_ba02_manifest` accepts ONLY
  a `Ba02Manifest`; a missing/unreadable file fails closed; NO self-evidence acceptance source; NO committed
  synthetic manifest (RO-LIVE-06 / CN-OPERATOR-EVIDENCE-01, `ci_check_ba02_evidence_manifest_schema.sh`).**
  **(N-F-G-E) `ade_node::node_sync::pump_lookahead` MUST stop the opportunistic `try_recv` drain at a CLOSED
  LITERAL `MAX_WIRE_PUMP_LOOKAHEAD` (so the existing bounded `mpsc` back-pressures) — NO unbounded drain, NO
  CLI/env/config override (DC-LIVEMEM-01); `ade_runtime::network::mux_pump::session_err_to_halt` MUST handle the
  new `SessionError::ReassemblyBufferOverflow` variant in its exhaustive (no-wildcard) `match` and drop the peer.
  The closed verdict-decoupled `NodeBlockSource` contract, the relay-loop containment gate, and the served-chain
  handoff fence MUST stay byte-unchanged.**

### Project-specific additions (Ade)

- **Live-feed bounded-memory honest scope + boundary (N-F-G-E, load-bearing — do NOT soften / do NOT broaden):**
  N-F-G-E bounds **peer-driven memory on the live `--mode node` feed BEFORE authoritative decode/apply** — and
  nothing more. Two closed literal caps fail closed in front of the BLUE `ade_codec` decode path
  (`MAX_REASSEMBLY_TAIL_BYTES = 16 MiB` → the additive closed `SessionError::ReassemblyBufferOverflow` → drop the
  peer; `MAX_WIRE_PUMP_LOOKAHEAD = 256` → the bounded `mpsc` back-pressures), with **NO CLI / env / config escape
  hatch**. The claim is **NARROW**: it is **NOT** full network DoS resistance, **NOT** peer resource fairness,
  **NOT** BA-02 / live-evidence readiness — other DoS surfaces (the per-connection aggregate ceiling across the
  ~10 independent per-protocol reassembly buffers, per-connection-COUNT / peer-fairness) remain future hardening
  slices. The bounds are **defensive implementation constants, NOT Cardano semantic parameters** (tighten-only).
  **NO BLUE change** (`ade_codec` byte-unchanged); **NO new `NodeBlockSource` / `CoordinatorEvent` variant**; the
  serve/forge/containment fences are **byte-unchanged**; **no live-evidence / BA-02 / RO-LIVE flip or claim**.
  `DC-LIVEMEM-01` is `tier = derived` (operational hardening, NOT BLUE consensus law). _(G-E does not alter the
  G-C live-feed wiring, the serve mechanism, or any BLUE authority.)_
- **Live-feed + BA-02-evidence honest scope + boundary (N-F-G-C, load-bearing — do not soften):** N-F-G-C closes
  the **MECHANICAL live-feed + evidence scaffolding ONLY**. The `--mode node` `On` arm is **live-feed-wireable**
  from `--peer` (reusing the closed admission dial + pump; a `from_wire_pump` FILL of the closed `WirePump` arm —
  no new variant, no new wire authority); with a live feed the forge is observable at a due leader slot. **Peer
  ACCEPT is NOT claimed — it is operator-gated** (`RO-LIVE-01` partial / `blocked_until_operator_stake_available`),
  proven only by an operator-captured peer log through `correlate`. The BA-02 evidence I/O (`ba02_pass`) reads a
  real operator-captured peer-log file through the SOLE `Ba02Manifest` constructor; `write_ba02_manifest` accepts
  ONLY a `Ba02Manifest`; **no synthetic manifest is committed** (the new gate is vacuous-until-committed +
  sha256-bound). **Ade self-accept / `ForgeSucceeded` / served-block / wire success ≠ peer acceptance.** With NO
  `--peer` the empty source still halts before any `ForgeTick`. The durable tip still advances only via
  `run_node_sync → pump_block`; `run_node_sync` UNMODIFIED; `ci_check_node_run_loop_containment.sh` byte-unchanged.
  **NO new BLUE authority / canonical type, no new `NodeBlockSource` / `CoordinatorEvent` variant.** **The bounty
  acceptance criterion (an operator-witnessed accepted block) is NOT satisfied by this cluster. BA-02 is satisfied
  nowhere.**
- **Self-accept→serve handoff honest scope + boundary (N-F-G-B, load-bearing — do not soften):** N-F-G-B is
  **serve-authority only** — it proves the serve *mechanism* on the `--mode node` spine admits **only** a BLUE
  self-accepted artifact, via the constructor-fenced `SelfAcceptedHandoff` carried into a **sibling** served-chain
  admit task whose sole mutation is the single `ServedChainHandle::push_atomic` fed by `into_accepted()`. The
  relay-loop body forwards a **typed channel send only**, so `ci_check_node_run_loop_containment.sh` is
  **byte-/semantically unchanged**. It introduces **no new BLUE authority / canonical type**, adds **no new
  `CoordinatorEvent` variant**, and makes **NO peer-acceptance / BA-02 / RO-LIVE acceptance claim**. `DC-NODE-06`
  is ENFORCED. _(N-F-G-C added the LIVE FEED around this serve mechanism; the serve mechanism is unchanged.)_
- **Forge-fidelity honest scope + boundary (N-F-G-A, load-bearing — do not soften):** N-F-G-A is
  **forge-fidelity hardening on the relay spine** — real cardano-cli config ingress (opcert + genesis),
  oracle-bound **current** `ProtocolParameters` (no longer `::default()`), a before-anchor clock→slot
  fail-closed guard (S3), and an off-epoch forge fail-closed guard *before* leadership / KES signing (S4). It
  does **NOT** serve / admit / gossip / advance a durable tip. The forge stays **subordinate + self-accept-only**;
  `run_relay_loop`'s containment is **semantically unchanged**. The two new boundaries are **fail-closed walls,
  not silent saturations**. `protocol_params` carries **no float path**. The S1 reference fixture is **evidence
  input, never runtime authority**. The `protocol_params_json` preimage stays **OUTSIDE** the frozen 15-field
  `LiveConsensusInputsCanonical` fingerprint (a non-fingerprinted additive carry).
- **Operator-key ingress honest scope + boundary (N-F-F, load-bearing — do not soften):** N-F-F is
  **operator-key ingress + the binary `Some`/`None` forge flip**. The binary is **forge-CAPABLE with real
  operator keys**; key custody is **RED-confined** to `ProducerShell`. **Mithril stays the bootstrap/recovery
  layer, untouched.**
- **Forge-tick honest scope + boundary (N-F-E, load-bearing):** N-F-E is a **hermetic, single-epoch,
  self-accept-only** forge-tick wiring cluster. **NO serve/broadcast/gossip; NO durable apply / tip mutation.**
- **Relay-run-loop honest scope (N-F-D):** the live relay run-loop is **relay-only** — N-F-G-C wires a **live
  unbounded peer** into the `WirePump` arm (the feed-side RO-LIVE-01 follow-on); the operator-witnessed live
  ACCEPT remains the gating follow-on.
- **Node-lifecycle honest scope (N-F-C):** PHASE4-N-F-C proves the node lifecycle mechanics through evidence
  closure; it does NOT claim live BA-02. `ba02_evidence` + the N-F-G-C `ba02_pass` I/O wrapper are reached by no
  binary arm (tested only).
- **Recovered-state surface is populate-contained AND consume-fenced (N-F-A populate / N-F-C consume; N-F-E +
  N-F-F + N-F-G-A exercise):** populated ONLY on the verified-bootstrap path; read back ONLY by the warm-start
  restore (CN-CINPUT-02). The forge-time `produce_mode` path may not populate them and stays diagnostic.
- **No new bootstrap-source plugin seam (N-Y hard rejection, carried into N-Z + N-F-A + N-F-C + N-F-F + N-F-G-A +
  N-F-G-C):** a new seed source attaches by populating `BootstrapInputs.genesis_initial` and routing through
  `bootstrap_initial_state` — NEVER via a `GenesisAnchor` / `MithrilAnchor` trait or plugin registry.
  **Operator-key ingress (N-F-F), forge fidelity (N-F-G-A), and the live feed (N-F-G-C) are NOT a bootstrap** —
  they reuse the single recovered `BootstrapState` as the forge base, call no Mithril, and create no second
  bootstrap.
- **Mithril seed-point independence (N-Z hard rule, DC-MITHRIL-02):** the anchor `seed_point` MUST originate
  from an operator-supplied origin structurally independent of the manifest; `verify_mithril_binding`
  cross-checks the two and fails closed; the binding must run before any storage init.
- **No synthetic forge state (N-T):** `produce_mode` MUST NOT construct `SyntheticForgeInputs`, a zero-stake
  `LeaderScheduleAnswer`, or an inline `LedgerState::new(...)` forge base.
- **No durability in the produce_mode forge path (N-U scope):** forged-block durability is deferred to N-U
  (§7). The network forward-sync durability (received blocks) DID land in N-Y; the N-F-E/N-F-F/N-F-G-A
  relay-loop forge tick advances NO durable tip (self-accept-only).
- **Bounded peer-driven memory (CLOSED by N-F-G-E — was the N-F-G-C-exposed §7 candidate #6):** the live
  `--mode node` feed's unbounded mux-reassembly tail (`ade_network::session::core`) + unbounded
  `WirePump.lookahead` (`ade_node::node_sync`) are now BOUNDED before authoritative decode/apply by two closed
  literal caps — `MAX_REASSEMBLY_TAIL_BYTES = 16 MiB` (fail-closed via the additive closed
  `SessionError::ReassemblyBufferOverflow` → drop the peer) + `MAX_WIRE_PUMP_LOOKAHEAD = 256` (the bounded `mpsc`
  back-pressures), each with NO CLI/env/config escape hatch, fenced by the NEW `ci_check_live_feed_memory_bounds.sh`
  (DC-LIVEMEM-01). **NARROW claim — bounded memory before decode/apply, NOT full network DoS resistance / peer
  fairness / BA-02 readiness** (per-connection aggregate + per-connection-COUNT / peer-fairness remain future
  hardening). The prior CBOR length-overflow remote-DoS (N-X) was already NOT reintroduced.
- **Registry `code_locus` must track source moves (`5db9aae`):** any rule citing a renamed/moved `crates/**.rs`
  or `ci/**.sh` path must have its `code_locus` updated; `ci_check_registry_code_locus_exists.sh` fails closed
  on a stale pointer.
- **`cardano_crypto::kes` is a `#[cfg(test)]` oracle only** under `crates/ade_crypto/src/**`. `pallas-*`
  confined to `ade_plutus`.
- **Commit-attribution override (CLAUDE.md):** this repo carries a model-attribution trailer on commit messages
  only (bounty requirement). Source comments, PRs, releases, issue comments still follow the global
  no-AI-attribution rule.
- **Grounding-doc → ade-atlas rebuild trigger (operational infra — NOT a code seam):** the downstream
  `ade-atlas` repo polls the grounding docs every 10 min. It attaches nothing to the node's authority surface.

0. **Live network serve + operator-peer surface (PARTLY closed by N-F-G-C; the operator-witnessed ACCEPT remains
   the gating follow-on).** N-F-G-B CLOSED the self-accept→serve handoff (`DC-NODE-06` enforced). **N-F-G-C wired
   the live feed (consume side)** — when `--peer` is supplied, `spawn_live_wire_pump_source` builds a LIVE
   `NodeBlockSource::WirePump` (reusing the closed `dial_for_admission` + `run_admission_wire_pump`; a
   `from_wire_pump` FILL of the closed `WirePump` arm), so `LoopStep::ForgeTick` is reachable in production
   (`live_wire_pump_feed_reaches_forge_tick`) and a self-accepted forged block is served byte-identically over
   in-process block-fetch (`live_feed_forge_serve_loopback_returns_forged_block`). **N-F-G-C also scaffolded the
   operator-pass evidence path** — the `docs/evidence/phase4-n-f-g-c-operator-pass-README.md` runbook + the RED
   `ba02_pass::correlate_peer_log_file` wiring over the GREEN `correlate` + the no-synthetic-manifest gate
   `ci_check_ba02_evidence_manifest_schema.sh`. **What REMAINS gating:** the **operator-witnessed live ACCEPT** —
   a real operator-captured peer log through `correlate` against a peer that can grant leadership (C1 private
   testnet or C2 preprod with provisioned stake). `RO-LIVE-01` stays `partial` /
   `blocked_until_operator_stake_available`; `RO-LIVE-06` is NOT a live-BA-02 claim. _Confirm: the operator-pass
   execution is the next live leg; it MUST NOT relax the relay-loop containment / served-chain handoff fence, and
   a peer-ACCEPT claim stays gated on a real operator-captured peer log through `correlate` (no synthetic manifest)._
1. **Live unbounded peer → observable forge ACCEPT (RO-LIVE-01 follow-on — DECLARED, feed-side now wired by
   N-F-G-C).** N-F-G-C wired the **feed side** — a live unbounded cardano-node peer over the wire drives
   `run_node_sync` (the prior feed-side follow-on, now closed). What REMAINS is the **operator-witnessed
   observable forge ACCEPT** against a peer that can grant Ade leadership (operator-gated; `RO-LIVE-01` partial /
   `blocked_until_operator_stake_available`). _Confirm: does `NodeBlockSource` stay a closed verdict-decoupled
   contract (a `from_wire_pump` FILL, not a plugin point for alternative sources)? It does at this HEAD._
2. **Live BA-02 (RO-LIVE-06 follow-on — DECLARED, I/O scaffolded by N-F-G-C).** The schema + correlator mechanics
   are closed, and N-F-G-C wired the RED `ba02_pass` file I/O over the GREEN `correlate` (reached by no binary arm
   at this HEAD; tested only). A real BA-02 result needs a real operator-captured peer log naming the exact
   Ade-forged hash, run through `correlate`, against a peer that can grant leadership (operator-gated, distinct
   from RO-LIVE-01). Synthetic fixtures prove the mechanics only; the new gate is vacuous-until-committed +
   sha256-bound. BA-02 stays satisfied NOWHERE.
3. **Mithril import — remaining open obligations (RO-MITHRIL-IMPORT-01, still `partial`).** N-Z CLOSED item (b).
   Two seams remain deliberately NOT wired: **(a) seed-bytes-from-Mithril decode** and **(c) a committed
   reproducible Mithril fixture + CI/release evidence**. `bootstrap_from_mithril_snapshot` is composition-only
   with **NO standalone argv flag**. _(N-F-F/N-F-G-A/N-F-G-C left Mithril untouched.)_
4. **N-U — forged-block durability (DECLARED).** WAL / ChainDB / snapshot / warm-start for producer-**forged**
   blocks. Out of N-T scope. The N-Y forward-sync durability covers **received** blocks; the
   N-F-E/N-F-F/N-F-G-A/N-F-G-B forge tick is self-accept-only and advances no durable tip.
5. **Sync-evidence live leg (N-Y — RO-SYNC-EVIDENCE-01, `partial`).** The snapshot→tip sync-evidence manifest
   schema is enforced but vacuously satisfied until a manifest is committed. An operator-witnessed execution
   gate, not a code seam.
6. **~~Bounded peer-driven memory on the now-live feed~~ — CLOSED by PHASE4-N-F-G-E (RETIRED from this list).**
   _(Added at the G-C close from the G-C per-cluster security-review MEDIUM; closed at HEAD `6f848825`.)_ The two
   surfaces — the per-mini-protocol mux-reassembly tail (`ade_network::session::core`) and the content-blind
   `WirePump.lookahead` (`ade_node::node_sync`, `VecDeque<Vec<u8>>`) — are now BOUNDED before authoritative
   decode/apply by **two closed literal caps**: `MAX_REASSEMBLY_TAIL_BYTES = 16 MiB` (fail-closed via the additive
   closed `SessionError::ReassemblyBufferOverflow` → `mux_pump::session_err_to_halt` drops the peer; no silent
   truncation, no partial decode) + `MAX_WIRE_PUMP_LOOKAHEAD = 256` (the bounded `mpsc`, cap 64, back-pressures
   the pump). Both carry **NO CLI / env / config escape hatch** and are fenced by the NEW
   `ci_check_live_feed_memory_bounds.sh` (DC-LIVEMEM-01, `enforced`). The over-cap behavior is fail-closed
   (drop-and-disconnect / back-pressure — never a silent tip graft or a fabricated block); the relay-loop
   containment gate + the verdict-decoupled `NodeBlockSource` contract are byte-unchanged. **Scope was NARROW —
   bounded memory before decode/apply only.** It is **NOT** full network DoS resistance, **NOT** peer resource
   fairness, **NOT** BA-02 / live-evidence readiness; the per-connection aggregate ceiling across the ~10
   independent per-protocol reassembly buffers and per-connection-COUNT / peer-fairness limits remain SEPARATE,
   out-of-scope future hardening slices.

### Operator-pass execution gates (schema enforced, execution blocked)

- **CN-OPERATOR-EVIDENCE-01 / CN-CONS-06 / RO-LIVE-01** — the manifest schema is enforced (N-F-G-C added the
  BA-02 manifest-schema gate `ci_check_ba02_evidence_manifest_schema.sh`, vacuous-until-committed + sha256-bound),
  but C1 (private testnet) / C2 (preprod) operator-pass execution is `blocked_until_operator_pass_executed` /
  `blocked_until_operator_stake_available`. With CN-FORGE-04 (N-W), CN-WIRE-08 (N-X), CN-NODE-03 (N-F-F
  operator-key ingress), DC-EPOCH-03 (N-F-G-A forge fidelity), DC-NODE-06 (N-F-G-B self-accept→serve handoff)
  enforced, AND N-F-G-C's live feed + BA-02 evidence I/O wired, the producer forge composition is mechanically
  complete through the serve step AND the `--mode node` binary is forge-CAPABLE with real operator keys + real
  current constants + two fail-closed boundaries + a LIVE `--peer` feed (so the forge is observable at a due
  leader slot). The remaining blocker is the OPERATOR-PASS live leg itself — an operator-captured peer log
  through `correlate` against a peer that can grant leadership (RO-LIVE-01 / RO-LIVE-06).
- **RO-LIVE-06 (BA-02, N-F-C; I/O wired N-F-G-C)** — the evidence schema + correlator mechanics + the RED file
  I/O are enforced/wired, but a real BA-02 result is operator-gated. Synthetic fixtures CANNOT satisfy BA-02;
  the committed-manifest gate is vacuous-until-committed + sha256-bound. Distinct from RO-LIVE-01.

## Generation notes

- Regenerated (scoped INCREMENTAL catch-up through ONE cluster) at HEAD `6f848825` (`git rev-parse --short
  HEAD`), downstream of the CODEMAP regenerated at the same HEAD. The prior on-disk SEAMS was generated at the
  **PHASE4-N-F-G-C close** (`351d46bc` / 118 CI checks / 313 rules — the live WirePump feed + BA-02 evidence
  wiring on the `--mode node` spine). This refresh catches it up through **PHASE4-N-F-G-E** (live-feed bounded
  memory before authoritative decode/apply on the `--mode node` spine, closing now at `6f848825`: a single slice
  S1 `6f848825` — the GREEN `ade_network::session::core` `MAX_REASSEMBLY_TAIL_BYTES = 16 MiB` reassembly-tail cap
  + the additive closed `SessionError::ReassemblyBufferOverflow` (GREEN `session::event`), the RED
  `ade_node::node_sync` `MAX_WIRE_PUMP_LOOKAHEAD = 256` lookahead cap, the RED `ade_runtime::network::mux_pump`
  variant→`PeerHaltReason::ChainSyncDecodeError` mapping, and the NEW `ci_check_live_feed_memory_bounds.sh` gate;
  doc commit `5a4d8c12`).
- **N-F-G-E deltas are CLOSED surfaces / fail-closed memory bounds, NOT new extension points (load-bearing).**
  The two caps are **closed literal constants** (`MAX_REASSEMBLY_TAIL_BYTES = 16 MiB`, `MAX_WIRE_PUMP_LOOKAHEAD =
  256`) with **NO CLI / env / config escape hatch** — classified under §3 Closed / §4 Frozen. The reassembly cap
  fails closed via the additive closed `SessionError::ReassemblyBufferOverflow` (NO wildcard; sole exhaustive
  consumer `mux_pump::session_err_to_halt` → drop the peer); the lookahead cap back-pressures the existing bounded
  `mpsc`. **No new module, no new `NodeBlockSource` / `CoordinatorEvent` variant.** **No BLUE crate was modified**
  — the 456 canonical-type total is unchanged (`session/` is GREEN-by-content, NOT a BLUE `ade_network` submodule
  path, so the new `SessionError` variant is NOT canonical-counted); the four changed files
  (`session::{core.rs, event.rs}` GREEN-by-content, `node_sync.rs` + `mux_pump.rs` RED) touch no BLUE crate. The
  cap fires **BEFORE** the BLUE `ade_codec` decode path (`ade_codec` byte-unchanged). **`run_node_sync` /
  `run_relay_loop` containment + the served-chain handoff fence are byte-unchanged.** _(N-F-G-C deltas — the live
  WirePump feed reusing the closed dial/pump + the `ba02_pass` evidence I/O — are carried forward unchanged; G-E
  changed neither.)_
- **N-F-G-E CLOSED §7 candidate #6** (bounded mux-reassembly tail + WirePump lookahead — the live-feed
  peer-driven memory surface added at the G-C close from the G-C security-review MEDIUM): two closed literal caps
  (`MAX_REASSEMBLY_TAIL_BYTES = 16 MiB` + `MAX_WIRE_PUMP_LOOKAHEAD = 256`), each fail-closed before authoritative
  decode/apply, NO CLI/env/config escape hatch, fenced by the NEW `ci_check_live_feed_memory_bounds.sh`
  (DC-LIVEMEM-01). **Candidate #6 is RETIRED from §7.** **G-E closed ONE specific live-feed memory surface — it is
  NOT full network DoS resistance, NOT peer resource fairness, NOT BA-02 / live-evidence readiness** (the
  per-connection aggregate ceiling across the ~10 independent per-protocol reassembly buffers and
  per-connection-COUNT / peer-fairness remain SEPARATE, out-of-scope future hardening slices). **The OTHER §7
  candidates are carried UNCHANGED and were NOT broadened:** #0 (live network serve + operator-peer — partly
  closed at G-C; operator-witnessed ACCEPT still the gating follow-on, RO-LIVE-01 partial / RO-LIVE-06 live BA-02
  not claimed), #1 (live unbounded peer → observable forge ACCEPT), #2 (live BA-02), #3 (RO-MITHRIL-IMPORT-01
  remaining), #4 (N-U forged-block durability), #5 (RO-SYNC-EVIDENCE-01 live leg).
- **Boundary honesty (load-bearing — do NOT soften / do NOT broaden).** N-F-G-E bounds **peer-driven memory on
  the live `--mode node` feed BEFORE authoritative decode/apply** — and nothing more. It is **NOT** full network
  DoS resistance, **NOT** peer resource fairness, **NOT** BA-02 / live-evidence readiness (the per-connection
  aggregate ceiling across the ~10 independent per-protocol reassembly buffers and per-connection-COUNT /
  peer-fairness remain SEPARATE, out-of-scope future hardening). The reassembly cap is checked post-extend
  (single-buffer transient peak `cap + one <=64 KiB frame` ~16.06 MiB); the per-connection aggregate is ~10×
  single-buffer, still O(constant)/connection. The bounds are **closed literal constants, NOT Cardano semantic
  parameters** (tighten-only, no CLI/env/config escape hatch). **NO BLUE change** (`ade_codec` byte-unchanged);
  the serve/forge/containment fences are **byte-unchanged**; **no live-evidence / BA-02 / RO-LIVE flip or claim**.
  (Carried — N-F-G-C: peer ACCEPT stays operator-gated; `correlate` is the SOLE `Ba02Manifest` constructor; no
  synthetic manifest committed; the bounty acceptance criterion is NOT satisfied. BA-02 is satisfied nowhere.)
- N-F-G-E delta verified at `6f848825` (grep/ls/git only — no `cargo`):
  - `crates/ade_network/src/session/core.rs`: `const MAX_REASSEMBLY_TAIL_BYTES: usize = 16 * 1024 * 1024;` (line
    49; `//! GREEN`); the post-drain check `if buf.len() > MAX_REASSEMBLY_TAIL_BYTES { return Err(
    SessionError::ReassemblyBufferOverflow { protocol, len, cap: MAX_REASSEMBLY_TAIL_BYTES }) }` (lines 249-253);
    `session/` is GREEN-by-content (NOT a BLUE `ade_network` submodule `core_path`), so the new variant is NOT
    canonical-counted.
  - `crates/ade_network/src/session/event.rs`: the additive `SessionError::ReassemblyBufferOverflow { protocol,
    len, cap }` variant (line ~195; doc-comment names the `MAX_REASSEMBLY_TAIL_BYTES` bound).
  - `crates/ade_runtime/src/network/mux_pump.rs`: `fn session_err_to_halt(err: &SessionError) -> PeerHaltReason`
    (line 278) is an exhaustive `match` (NO wildcard) whose new arm `SessionError::ReassemblyBufferOverflow { .. }
    => PeerHaltReason::ChainSyncDecodeError` (lines 302-303) drops the peer.
  - `crates/ade_node/src/node_sync.rs`: `const MAX_WIRE_PUMP_LOOKAHEAD: usize = 256;` (line 58); the cap check
    `if lookahead.len() >= MAX_WIRE_PUMP_LOOKAHEAD { … }` in `pump_lookahead` (line 126); the bounded
    `LIVE_WIRE_PUMP_CHANNEL_CAP = 64` (carried) back-pressures the pump. `NodeBlockSource` is still the closed
    2-variant `{WirePump, InMemory}` — UNCHANGED.
  - Gate `ci/ci_check_live_feed_memory_bounds.sh` present (verifies both bounds are CLOSED LITERAL constants AND
    not wired to CLI / env / config — guard 3; line comments stripped first). `ls ci/ci_check_*.sh | wc -l` =
    **119** at `6f848825`. `ci_check_node_run_loop_containment.sh` + `ci_check_served_chain_handoff_fence.sh`
    byte-unchanged.
  - Registry: `grep -cE '^\[\[rules\]\]' docs/ade-invariant-registry.toml` = **314**. NEW `DC-LIVEMEM-01`
    (`tier = derived`, operational-hardening, `status = enforced`) present (`grep -n 'DC-LIVEMEM-01'`). No rule
    weakened.
  - Carried (N-F-G-C, verified present + unchanged at this HEAD): `crates/ade_node/src/ba02_pass.rs` (`//! RED`;
    `correlate_peer_log_file` + `write_ba02_manifest` accepting ONLY a `Ba02Manifest`); `node_sync.rs`
    `from_wire_pump` (a FILL of the closed `WirePump` arm); `node_lifecycle.rs` `spawn_live_wire_pump_source`
    (reuses `dial_for_admission` + `run_admission_wire_pump` verbatim); `admission::bootstrap::build_n2n_version_table`
    `pub(crate)`; gates `ci_check_ba02_evidence_manifest_schema.sh` + the broadened
    `ci_check_served_chain_handoff_fence.sh`.
- Counts at `6f848825` (N-F-G-E close, this refresh): **456** canonical types (Δ 0 vs the prior SEAMS — no BLUE
  crate modified; `session/` is GREEN-by-content so the new `SessionError` variant is NOT canonical-counted; the
  two caps are closed consts, the lookahead cap is RED), **119** CI checks (Δ +1 vs the prior SEAMS's 118 — the
  one G-E gate `ci_check_live_feed_memory_bounds.sh`), **314** registry rules (Δ +1 vs the prior 313 — NEW
  `DC-LIVEMEM-01`, `tier = derived`, `enforced`; no rule weakened). All counts match the CODEMAP header
  regenerated at the same HEAD.
- All N-F-G-C / N-F-G-B / N-F-G-A / N-F-F / N-F-E / N-F-D / N-F-C / N-F-A / N-Z / N-Y closed surfaces re-verified
  present on disk at this HEAD and unchanged by N-F-G-E (no BLUE crate modified; `ade_codec` byte-unchanged;
  `run_relay_loop` / `run_node_sync` containment + the served-chain handoff fence byte-unchanged; the live-feed
  wiring + the serve mechanism unchanged); the refresh annotated only the seams N-F-G-E added (the two closed
  memory caps + the additive closed `SessionError::ReassemblyBufferOverflow` + the new gate) and the surfaces they
  touched (the live-feed pipeline's pre-decode memory bound, the `WirePump` lookahead-depth cap). The G-C live
  WirePump feed + `ba02_pass` evidence I/O are carried forward unchanged.
- **Cross-reference check (CODEMAP ↔ SEAMS):** every module named in this SEAMS appears in the CODEMAP
  regenerated at the same HEAD — the N-F-G-E surfaces `ade_network::session::core` (`MAX_REASSEMBLY_TAIL_BYTES`,
  `//! GREEN`), `ade_network::session::event` (`SessionError::ReassemblyBufferOverflow`, `//! GREEN`),
  `ade_node::node_sync` (`MAX_WIRE_PUMP_LOOKAHEAD`, `//! RED`), `ade_runtime::network::mux_pump` (`session_err_to_halt`,
  `//! RED`), AND the carried N-F-G-C (`ba02_pass` `//! RED`, `node_lifecycle::spawn_live_wire_pump_source`,
  `node_sync::from_wire_pump`, `admission::bootstrap::build_n2n_version_table`, `ba02_evidence` `//! GREEN`) /
  N-F-G-B (`producer::self_accepted_handoff`) / N-F-G-A (`consensus_inputs::protocol_params`,
  `clock::checked_millis_to_slot`, `node_sync::forge_epoch_admission`, `operator_forge`, `consensus::genesis_pinning`)
  modules are all inventoried there; the CODEMAP header's PHASE4-N-F-G-E delta names the same two caps + the
  additive `SessionError` variant + `DC-LIVEMEM-01` + the new gate. The **456 / 119 / 314** counts match the
  CODEMAP header. No stale module references. The one new CI gate (`ci_check_live_feed_memory_bounds.sh`) is named
  in both docs.
- **Stale `.idd-config.json` fields (surfaced, not edited).** `.idd-config.json` `_invariant_registry_doc` reads
  "313 entries" — now **314** at this close (NEW `DC-LIVEMEM-01`); `_head_deltas_baseline` is `90791691` (the
  N-F-G-C close) — it should be bumped to `6f848825` on the N-F-G-E HEAD_DELTAS refresh. (This doc does not edit
  config.)
- The doc is regenerated, not edited. If a value drifts, fix the source, not the doc.
- NOTE: no `cargo build`/`test`/`check` was run during this regeneration (grep/ls/git only, per the task
  constraint).
